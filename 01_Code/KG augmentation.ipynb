Carbon\\nNeutrality: Carbon neutrality, as defined by the United Nations, refers to\\nachieving a net-zero carbon footprint by balancing a measured amount of carbon\\nreleased with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough\\ncarbon credits to make up the difference.

CHAPTER ONE:\\nLINKAGES BETWEEN ENERGY SYSTEMS AND CLIMATE CHANGE How Energy Systems Contribute\\nto Climate Change? The concept of a global carbon footprint is crucial in\\nclimate change studies, as it provides a quantitative evaluation of the various\\nways in which human activities contribute to global warming. This phrase refers\\nto the total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon-based gases\\nreleased into the atmosphere due to using fossil fuels in various human\\nactivities, either individually or collectively on a global scale.', 'doc_id': 'SEA Module 8 - Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in the Energy Sector.txt', 'character_index': 6357, 'Category': ['Policy'], 'Tags': ['Carbon Neutrality; Climate Change; Policy']}, 4: {'name': 'biomass', 'extract': 'Energy use in\\nagriculture and fishing (1.7%) Energy-related emissions from the use of\\nmachinery in agriculture and fishing, such as fuel for farm machinery and\\nfishing vessels Fugitive emissions from energy production: 5.8% --\\nFugitive emissions from oil and gas (3.9%):\\xa0fugitive emissions are the often-\\naccidental leakage of methane to the atmosphere during oil and gas extraction\\nand transportation, from damaged or poorly maintained pipes.

Oil wells can\\nrelease gases, including methane, during extraction – producers often don’t have\\nan existing network of pipelines to transport it, or it wouldn’t make economic\\nsense to provide the infrastructure needed to effectively capture and transport\\nit.

While the amounts released per unit of energy are generally\\nlower than CO2, the high global warming potential of N2O makes these emissions\\nparticularly impactful. The main sources of N2O emissions include fossil fuel\\ncombustion, biomass burning, industrial processes like nitric acid production,\\nand agricultural activities related to biofuels.

The NAPs are implemented in an\\nintegrated approach connecting with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\\nand aligning with UNDP’s Climate Promise. The NAPs are committed to accelerate\\nclimate action and progress on SDGs by integrating climate risk across all\\ndevelopment levels – local, national, regional, and global. Livelihoods UNDP\\nsupports the enhancement of climate-resilient livelihoods for vulnerable\\ncommunities, including resilient agriculture value chains (such as utilizing\\nrenewable energy as the energy source for agricultural activities). The main\\nworks include supporting entrepreneurs, development of public goods to build\\nmarket resilience, and promoting income diversification and improved\\nproductivity.

Global energy access and affordability disparities\\nGlobal energy access and affordability disparities are crucial issues to achieve\\nsustainable development, impacting billions of lives worldwide. These\\ndisparities manifest in various forms, including the unequal distribution of\\nelectricity access, limited access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, and\\nthe financial ability of households to afford clean energy solutions. The\\nchallenge is not just about providing access but ensuring that energy is clean,\\naffordable, reliable, and sustainable.

According to IRENA\\'s 1.5°C\\nScenario, renewables are expected to constitute 91% of the energy mix by 2050,\\nleading to a significant surge in renewables-based installed capacity from 3,300\\ngigawatts (GW) in 2022 to a staggering 33,000 GW in 2050. This transformative\\nshift envisions 90% of all road vehicles being electric and hydrogen accounting\\nfor 14% of total final energy consumption, necessitating an annual tripling of\\nnew renewables, averaging 1,000 GW. This expansive development of sustainable\\nenergy technology and infrastructure will substantially amplify the demand for\\nspecific minerals and metals, collectively referred to as \"critical materials.\" The shift towards renewable energy sources relies heavily on critical minerals. These minerals are vital components in clean energy technologies like solar\\npanels, wind turbines, and electric vehicle batteries. As the world transitions\\naway from fossil fuels, the demand for these critical minerals is expected to\\nsoar, creating a crucial link between sustainable energy and the resources\\nneeded to achieve it. As of now, there is no universally accepted definition of\\ncritical materials, as their criticality depends on subjective and location-\\nspecific factors. Core criteria include economic importance for a specific\\neconomy, the level of supply risk influenced by factors such as scarcity,\\nproximity of supply, extraction and refining complexities, concentration of\\nsupply across the value chain, and the absence of viable alternative sources.', 'doc_id': 'SEA Module 4 - Just Energy Transition.txt', 'character_index': 49590, 'Category': ['Economic'], 'Tags': ['Critical Minerals; Minerals; Economic']}, 279: {'name': 'concentrated solar power', 'extract': 'Figure 14 presents the\\nfindings of a lifecycle GHG assessment conducted by UNECE (2022) for different\\nelectricity generation technologies.
