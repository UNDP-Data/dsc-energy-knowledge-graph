        "Description": "Time-of-use pricing is a pricing strategy that is enabled by smart metering technologies. It involves varying the price of electricity based on the time of day, with higher prices during peak demand periods and lower prices during off-peak periods. Time-of-use pricing encourages consumers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours, reducing strain on the grid and promoting energy efficiency.",

        "Description": "Demand response programs are initiatives that utilize smart metering technologies to incentivize consumers to reduce their electricity usage during periods of high demand. By providing real-time data on energy consumption and implementing time-of-use pricing, smart metering technologies enable utilities to send signals to consumers, encouraging them to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods. Demand response programs help to balance electricity supply and demand, reduce the need for additional power plants, and promote grid stability.",
