      "number of EU Directives and Regulations that are core to the regulation of the energy sectors of EU member states. Physical trading by market participants is exclusively to take place through the following platforms:\n",
      "o A day-ahead (“DA”) and intra-day (“ID”) market, to be set up by a new Albanian Power \n",
      "o Trading of long-term physical power is permitted based on cross-border capacity bought \n",
      "through cross-border capacity auctions.\n",
      " All other forms of trading will be financial, for example through bilateral Contract for Difference \n",
      "(CfDs) or establishment of decentralized futures markets.\n",
      " Specific t bidding rules are to be developed and an efficient regulatory monitoring regime shall be \n",
      "enforced with the goal to prevent the abuse of any market power by specific participants.\n",
      " A Balancing Market which integrates imbalance settlement is to be established and operated by \n",
      "OST, which will balance supply and demand, starting from the positions nominated by market \n",
      "participants through physical trading, and through contracting for balancing services directly.\n",
      "The new Market Model will have implications for existing commercial arrangements in the market:\n",
      " Where RES generators have Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) with the KESh public supplier, \n",
      "the intention will be for these volumes to be traded through the organized market, but with a \n",
      "Contract for Difference (“CfD”) put in place to keep the RES generator whole relative to the \n",
      "original PPA. The affected generators will need to be able to access a liquid reference price, which \n",

      "supplier role will also be transferred to OShEE once the new market model is implemented.\n",
      " There is currently a bilateral agreement in place between KESh and OShEE that governs supply of \n",
      "power to OShEE. In order to comply with the Market Model, these volumes will also be required \n",
      "to pass through the new power exchange. The Market Model refers to this as a “Market Maker \n",

      "can be summarized as follows:\n",
      " OST, in consultation with other market participants including ERE, is to continue work to\n",
      "finalize the market rules for implementing the new Market Model. In particular, rules for the \n",
      "Balancing Market, the procurement of balancing services, and the calculation of imbalance charges \n",

It is located on the Adriatic and Ionian Seas within the Mediterranean Sea and shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south. Tirana is its capital and largest city, followed by Durrës, Vlorë, and Shkodër. Albania displays varied climatic, geological, hydrological, and morphological conditions, defined in an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi). It possesses significant diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea. Albania has been inhabited by different civilisations over time, such as the Illyrians, Thracians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, and Ottomans. The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arbër in the 12th century. The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries. Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century, the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe. Albania remained under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries, during which many Albanians (known as Arnauts) attained high-ranking offices in the empire, especially in the Southern Balkans and Egypt. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, cultural developments, widely attributed to Albanians having gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength, conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance. After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars, the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912. In the 20th century, the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy, which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany. Enver Hoxha formed the People's Socialist Republic of Albania after World War II, modeled under the terms of Hoxhaism. The Revolutions of 1991 concluded the fall of communism in Albania and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania. Albania is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic. It is a developing country, ranking 67th in the Human Development Index, with an upper-middle income economy dominated by the service sector, followed by manufacturing. It went through a process of transition following the end of communism in 1990, from centralised planning to a market-based economy. Albania provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens. Albania is a member of the United Nations, World Bank, UNESCO, NATO, WTO, COE, OSCE, and OIC. It has been an official candidate for membership in the European Union since 2014. It is one of the founding members of the Energy Community, including the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and Union for the Mediterranean.\"}, {'entity': 'European Union', 'category': 'Organization', 'acronym': 'EU', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'United Nations Office for Project Services', 'category': 'Organization', 'acronym': 'UNOPS', 'summary': \"The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is a United Nations agency dedicated to implementing infrastructure and procurement projects for the United Nations System, international financial institutions, governments and other partners around the world.

Its activities have ranged from managing the construction of schools in Afghanistan, to building shelters in Haiti, to procuring ambulances to support the Ebola response in Liberia. More recently, UNOPS was a key partner to more than 80 countries and territories in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. UNOPS is a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and works closely with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), and the World Bank.

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and was further used to measure a country\\'s development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\\'s Human Development Report Office. The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of \\'potential\\' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\" The index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen\\'s work on human capabilities, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine. The index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the G7 members and others.'}, {'entity': 'United Nations', 'category': 'Organization', 'acronym': 'UN', 'summary': \"The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization whose stated purposes are to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. It is the world's largest and most familiar international organization. The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City, and has other main offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, and The Hague (home to the International Court of Justice). The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future world wars, succeeding the League of Nations, which was characterized as ineffective. On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the Charter, the organization's objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; with the addition of South Sudan in 2011, membership is now 193, representing almost all of the world's sovereign states. The organization's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles. UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council. By the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks. The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. The UN System includes a multitude of specialized agencies, funds and programmes such as the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. Additionally, non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work. The UN's chief administrative officer is the secretary-general, currently Portuguese politician and diplomat António Guterres, who began his first five year-term on 1 January 2017 and was re-elected on 8 June 2021. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. The UN, its officers, and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes, though other evaluations of its effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called it ineffective, biased, or corrupt.\"}, {'entity': 'United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework', 'category': 'Strategy', 'acronym': 'UNSDCF', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Sustainable Development Goals', 'category': 'Strategy', 'acronym': 'SDGs', 'summary': 'The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a \"shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future\". The SDGs were set up in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly (UN-GA) and are intended to be achieved by 2030. They are included in a UN-GA Resolution called the 2030 Agenda or what is colloquially known as Agenda 2030. The SDGs were developed in the Post-2015 Development Agenda as the future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals which were ended in 2015. The SDGs emphasize the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development, by putting sustainability at their center. The 17 SDGs are: No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, Reduced Inequality, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action, Life Below Water, Life On Land, Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, Partnerships for the Goals. Though the goals are broad and interdependent, two years later (6 July 2017), the SDGs were made more \"actionable\" by a UN Resolution adopted by the General Assembly. The resolution identifies specific targets for each goal, along with indicators that are being used to measure progress toward each target. The year by which the target is meant to be achieved is usually between 2020 and 2030. For some of the targets, no end date is given. There are cross-cutting issues and synergies between the different goals. Cross-cutting issues include gender equality, education, culture and health. With regards to SDG 13 on climate action, the IPCC sees robust synergies, particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans). Synergies amongst the SDGs are \"the good antagonists of trade-offs\". Some of the known and much discussed conceptual problem areas of the SDGs include: The fact that there are competing and too many goals (resulting in problems of trade-offs), that they are weak on environmental sustainability and that there are difficulties with tracking qualitative indicators. For example, these are two difficult trade-offs to consider: \"How can ending hunger be reconciled with environmental sustainability? (SDG targets 2.3 and 15.2) How can economic growth be reconciled with environmental sustainability? (SDG targets 9.2 and 9.4) \" The UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is the annual space for global monitoring of the SDGs, under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. However, it has so far failed to act as an orchestrator to promote system-wide coherence due to a lack of political leadership owing to divergent national interests. To facilitate monitoring of progress on the SDG implementation, a variety of tools exist to track and visualize this progress towards the goals. All intention is to make data more available and easily understood. For example, the \"SDG Tracker\", launched in June 2018, presents available data across all indicators. There were serious impacts and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on all 17 SDGs in the year 2020. A scientific assessment released in 2022 stated that the world is not on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and concluded that the SDGs have so far had only limited political effects in global, national and local governance since their launch in 2015.'}, {'entity': 'National Strategy for Development and Integration', 'category': 'Strategy', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Sustainable Development Goal', 'category': 'Strategy', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Agenda for Sustainable Development', 'category': 'Strategy', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Roma', 'category': 'Person', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Egyptian', 'category': 'Person', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Agenda', 'category': 'Strategy', 'summary': None}, {'entity': 'Government', 'category': 'Organization', 'summary': 'A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.

While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations.

Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny.
