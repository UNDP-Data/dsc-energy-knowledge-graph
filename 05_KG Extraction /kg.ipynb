    "  ## 1. Overview\n",
    "  You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "  - **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "  - The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "  ## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "  - **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "    - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",
    "  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "  {'- **Allowed Node Labels:**' + \", \".join(allowed_nodes) if allowed_nodes else \"\"}\n",
    "  {'- **Allowed Relationship Types**:' + \", \".join(allowed_rels) if allowed_rels else \"\"}\n",
    "  ## 3. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "  - Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "  - **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "  - **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "  ## 4. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\n",
    "  If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"),\n",
    "  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.\n",
    "  Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n",
    "  ## 5. Strict Compliance\n",
    "  Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n",
    "            \"\"\"),\n",
    "              (\"human\", \"Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}\"),\n",

    "1. Albania, with its population of 2.9 million, is an upper-middle-income country with a \n",
    "high Human Development Index of 0.791,\n",
    "Gender Development Index of 0.967 and Gender \n",
    "Inequality Index of 0.181. Women hold half of senior government positions. The economy \n",
    "is stable but underperforming, dependent on consumption and remittances, with low \n",
    "productivity and a limited tax base. Unemployment is structural and long-term at 11.8 per\n",
    "cent with a gender pay gap of 6.6 per cent.\n",
    "According to official figures, 38.3 per cent of \n",
    "the population suffer severe material deprivations and 23.4 per cent are at risk of falling into \n",
    "poverty (2018).\n",
    "2. Albania faces multiple challenges that drive vulnerabilities, including weaknesses in \n",
    "rule of law, uneven institutional capacity, service gaps, limited investments in social services,\n",
    "degradation of natural resources and few labour opportunities. \n",
    "3. The November 2019 earthquake and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic\n",
    "highlighted the need to address disaster risk management and the socioeconomic impact of \n",
    "these events, particularly on vulnerable groups and micro, small and medium-sized\n",
    "enterprises. The pandemic deepened gender inequalities, disproportionately affecting \n",
    "women, their livelihoods and access to essential health services, and increased incidents of \n",
    "gender-based violence.\n",
    "4. In March 2020, the European Union opened accession negotiations. The country’s \n",
    "vision of sustainable development, the key drivers for reforms and political and public \n",
    "priorities, are accession to the European Union, sustainable economic growth and inclusive \n",
    "prosperity. The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) III is under \n",
    "preparation with interim nationalized Sustainable Development Goal indicators and targets.\n",
    "5. This country programme reflects the comparative advantages of UNDP in supporting \n",
    "national reforms and upholding values of justice, human rights, equity and gender equality,\n",
    "through coordinated multisectoral approaches that facilitate systemic reforms. Drawing on \n",
    "its reputation as a United Nations system “integrator” for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \n",
    "Development and trusted impartial partner, UNDP will continue to liaise with the \n",
    "Government, donors and international institutions to mobilize financing to support economic \n",
    "transformation and eradication of multidimensional poverty; and establish systems that \n",
    "address risks, disasters and social injustice within the Sustainable Development Goals. Work \n",
    "at the local level and partnerships within the United Nations and across society position \n",
    "UNDP well to support aspirations to join the European Union and attain the outcomes of the \n",
    "United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF).\n",
    "6. The summary7 of the previous country programme’s performance concluded that \n",
    "UNDP support to development remains highly relevant in Albania. It is viewed as an \n",
    "innovative thought leader drawing on international experiences, with the ability to convene \n",
    "different stakeholders underpinning its integrator role for the 2030 Agenda through: \n",
    "(a) technical expertise, offering integrated and cross-sectoral solutions, combining policy and \n",
    "regulatory advice with capacity development; (b) a strong and agile operational presence; \n",
    "(c) established multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for European Union accession \n",
    "and the Sustainable Development Goals; and (d) trusted relations with all institutions.\n",
    "7 UNDP Albania country programme performance summary 2017-2021. The theory of change underpinning the country programme is that innovative \n",
    "approaches to inclusive, climate-friendly, gender-sensitive, sustainable growth in new \n",
    "competitive sectors, coupled with transparent, accountable governance systems, will boost \n",
    "jobs and businesses, identify investment opportunities, increase resilience and address \n",
    "interconnected vulnerabilities of climate, health and social injustice. UNDP will focus on \n",
    "local-level actions that together with national datasets and research, will inform national \n",
    "strategies and build forward better, particularly for those left behind.\n",
    "8. Those left behind include women, children from low-income households, single parent \n",
    "households, persons with disabilities, the Roma and Egyptian communities, refugees, \n",
    "migrants, isolated rural communities, the elderly and bisexual, transgender, queer and \n",
    "intersex persons. Women who work in the care economy and in addition belong to minority \n",
    "groups and lack education, are the most vulnerable. Discrimination, stigmatization and \n",
    "gender-based violence are prevalent. Through a portfolio approach, UNDP will target these \n",
    "groups and increase social cohesion and social protection, in partnership with national and \n",
    "local governments, United Nations agencies and civil society. UNDP will partner with \n",
    "United Nations agencies on joint programmes related to leaving no one behind, strategic \n",
    "policy options for Sustainable Development Goal financing and ending violence against \n",
    "women.\n",
    "9. The UNDP integration offer includes innovation, thematic expertise and financing for\n",
    "renewables and energy efficiency in line with Government’s plans to provide safe, affordable \n",
    "and clean energy to citizens; and for raising the national ambitions to combat climate change \n",
    "and increase resilience to natural and human-induced risks. UNDP will promote nature-based \n",
    "solutions to climate change adaptation and mitigation, not only tackling the climate crisis, \n",
    "inequality, poverty and food insecurity, but also providing incentives for new jobs in the \n",
    "maritime, blue and eco-circular economies. Partnering with United Nations agencies, UNDP \n",
    "will implement programmes on a green circular economy and sustainable economic \n",
    "development. \n",
    "10. Economic growth is too low to converge with European Union living standards and \n",
    "achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. With United Nations agencies, UNDP will \n",
    "support employment measures for vulnerable groups, integrate small and medium-sized \n",
    "enterprises in global value chains, and support civil society to increase women’s access to \n",
    "careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. There are few incentives for \n",
    "adoption and innovation in digital technology, but a national digital data strategy and \n",
    "increasing digitalization are critical to accelerating the fourth industrial revolution. UNDP \n",
    "will focus on integrated solutions that address cross-cutting problems, i.e., identifying nature\u0002based solutions that support the transition to a clean green economy, promote ecotourism and \n",
    "create new jobs in competitive sectors within the Western Balkan Regional Economic Area.\n",
    "11. Key barriers to effective and efficient provision of services and that impact public trust \n",
    "are the lack of integrity and accountability of public institutions, slow progress on judicial \n",
    "reforms and corruption. Building on previous successes, UNDP will work with civil society \n",
    "and the government to improve human capacities and data systems for performance, \n",
    "transparency and planning. UNDP will work on the quality of services and rule of law, in \n",
    "close collaboration with United Nations partners.\n",
    "12. With Albania positioning itself as a unifying actor for regional cooperation, security\n",
    "and stability, and taking the initial steps to establish the national disaster risk management \n",
    "system as a requirement to join the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism, UNDP will \n",
    "continue to promote knowledge-sharing and relevant practices across the subregion. To the \n",
    "extent possible, UNDP will promote South-South and triangular cooperation in support of \n",
    "these efforts.\n",
    "13. The report of the United Nations mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support \n",
    "mission to Albania and the United Nations country team reached consensus on three highly \n",
    "effective solutions for policy and programming to accelerate progress towards European \n",
    "Union accession and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals: (a) human capital \n",
    "development and social inclusion; (b) sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and \n",
    "resource management; (c) effective, people-centred governance, human rights, rule of law \n",
    "and gender equality. These are translated into four UNSDCF outcomes, fully adopted by \n",
    "UNDP and underpinned by five cross-cutting principles of human rights; gender equality;\n",
    "inclusion and equality; transparent civic participation; and innovation.\n",
    "14. The vision, value proposition and theory of change, which consolidates a number of \n",
    "past programmatic investments and proposes new transformative areas of action, were \n",
    "developed in consultation with over 200 partners representing civil society, private sector, \n",
    "academia, local and national governments, development partners and United Nations\n",
    "agencies, and validated in a meeting with over 17 Deputy Ministers. \n",
    "#II. Programme priorities and partnerships \n",
    "15. This country programme reflects the country’s development priorities as articulated in \n",
    "the NSDI and the UNSDCF 2022-2026. In addition, it is aligned with the UNDP Strategic \n",
    "Plan and contributes to different European Union acquis chapters.\n",
    "The Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators and national datasets are integral to programme\n",
    "outcomes and outputs. UNDP will contribute to these priorities, and application of its six \n",
    "signature solutions will help the country accelerate structural transformations. Specifically, \n",
    "UNDP will assist the country in the three main areas described below.\n",
    "16. Human capital development and social inclusion. Albania needs well-functioning,\n",
    "fully operational and funded social inclusion and protection policies. UNDP will work with \n",
    "national partners to promote social cohesion and strengthen social protection systems, \n",
    "services and financing mechanisms to increase coverage and quality for vulnerable groups.\n",
    "With United Nations agencies, UNDP will ensure civic engagement and capacities for \n",
    "dialogue and implementation of social care plans. \n",
    "17. COVID-19 generated a sense of urgency to operationalize national policies, strengthen \n",
    "local government capacities and design and fund inclusive, gender-responsive and evidence\u0002based services. To reach those most left behind, UNDP will expand services at municipal \n",
    "and national levels in education, health, social care, employment, vocational training and \n",
    "housing. UNDP, with the European Union, will continue investments in the education sector\n",
    "affected by the 2019 earthquake, adopting European Union standards and expanding \n",
    "information and communication technology measures as a post-COVID-19 recovery \n",
    "strategy. UNDP will technically lead implementation of the United Nations COVID-19 \n",
    "socioeconomic recovery plan.\n",
    "18. Sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and resource management.\n",
    "UNDP will support policies that accelerate an inclusive, productive and sustainable \n",
    "economy, enhance climate resilience and adaptation planning, and transition into a clean \n",
    "green economy, in line with the Government’s national strategies. This will be done through:\n",
    "(a) strengthening governance mechanisms to address climate change, biodiversity loss, \n",
    "pollution and land degradation; (b) promoting ecotourism and circular bioeconomy;\n",
    "(c) promote a “source-to-sea” approach, and strengthen transboundary cooperation for water \n",
    "resources management in the Drini River Basin; (d) address the skills mismatch of youth and \n",
    "women for innovation and digitalization; and (e) support value chains of micro, small and \n",
    "medium-sized enterprises, decent jobs and inclusive employment, particularly for persons \n",
    "with disabilities and women. UNDP will support industries to become more energy-efficient,\n",
    "increase the potential of the forestry sector for removal of greenhouse gasses, and support \n",
    "the country’s green growth trajectory. UNDP will support promotion of nature-based tourism \n",
    "that sustains livelihoods and protected areas, while improving ecosystem services and \n",
    "financial sustainability.\n",
