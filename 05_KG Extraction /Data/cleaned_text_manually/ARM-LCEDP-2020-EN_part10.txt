cascade comprises Spandaryan HPP ( 76 MW ) , Shamb HPP ( 171 MW ) and Tatev HPP ( 157 MW ) with a total installed capacity of 404 MW and a designed annual electricity generation of 1.16 billion kWh . ;  Small HPPs : Construction of small HPPs in Armenia has been a leading factor in the development of renewable energy resources , enhancing the energy security of Armenia . The majority of small HPPs under construction or in operation are run-of-river facilities designed for natural water flows . As of January 1 , 2017 , electricity was generated by 173 small HPPs , with total 328 MW installed capacity . In 2016 , the generation from small HPPs was around 937 million kWh , roughly 13 % of total generation . ; In terms of other renewable energy resources , in 2016 Armenia ’ s system also had one wind farm with a capacity of 2.64 MW and at the end of the year there were a small number of solar PV plants installed , with capacity of 273 kW and annual generation less than 0.1 million kWh Data on aggregate electricity generation and consumption in 2016 are presented in Table 1.2 . It should be noted that total technical losses in the electricity grid , including transmission and distribution networks , was just over around 10 % . There was also electricity trade both to north and to south . # ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND CONSUMPTION IN 2016 , in MILLION kWh : Total Annual Generation 7,315.3 of which the Power plant own use/ ( % of total ) has a share of 327.4/ ( 4.5 % ) and Losses/ ( % of total net input ) are 706.0/ ( 10.1 % ) . Export is 1,226.4 and Import 272.6 while Final consumption is 5,328.2 with a Number of Consumers of ~ 985,000 . These numbers present the shares of electricity generation in 2016 by fuel , which shows that the ANPP , gas-fired power plants and renewables ( including small HPPs and wind ) were distributed almost equally in the total generation mix , each accounting for around one-third of the total . Figure 1.2 presents the amount of electricity generated for domestic use in 2016 , with difference reflecting the fact that net exports are generally accounted for by gas generation , which increases the share of nuclear generation and of all renewables to 37 % each , leaving 26 % of electricity generation for domestic use dependent on imported gas . The Armenian electricity transmission system is owned by the state company “ High Voltage Electrical Networks ” CJSC . In 2016 , the total length of 220 kV and 110 kV High Voltage Lines ( HVL ) involved in electricity transmission was around 1,740 km ( 1,323 km of 220 kV HVL and 417 km of 110 kV HVL ) and the number of substations was 33 ( 15 220 kV substations and
