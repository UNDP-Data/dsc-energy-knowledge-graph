has access to electricity.14 Traditional energy sources are still widely used , including charcoal . Of the electricity produced and consumed , 64 per cent is from renewable sources , mainly hydropower.15 Seven solar hybrid plants were commissioned in 2018 . Although the Government promotes private investment in renewables , and there is growing private interest , the insufficient legal and regulatory environment , low cost of conventional energy , and limited access to foreign currency remain barriers . 11 . Gender and women ’ s rights and participation remain a challenge because of patriarchal customs and practices . Gender-based violence is widespread , with 8 per cent of women between 15 and 49 claiming to have suffered some type of sexual violence ; 35 per cent among ever-married women aged 15 to 49 . Women represent 35.5 per cent of senior government positions.17 Gender barriers remain inherent in the HIV context , such as unequal age of consent to marry and gaps in sexual and reproductive health rights . 12 . The National Development Plan ( NDP ) , 2018-2022 , has six pillars : ( a ) human development and wellbeing ; ( b ) inclusive , diversified and sustainable economic development ; ( c ) infrastructure for development ; ( d ) democracy , good governance , state reform and decentralization ; ( e ) harmonious development of territory ; and ( f ) stability , territorial integrity and the country ’ s role in the regional and international contexts . Financing for the $ 97 billion plan18 is primarily domestic , with additional funding from international financing institutions ( IFI ) and an IMF loan . In contrast , the official development assistance ( ODA ) estimate for 2018-2019 is $ 175 million . 13 . As Angola is undergoing political reforms and addressing major economic challenges , the NDP , 2018-2022 , puts significant emphasis on maintaining stability and peace . Main challenges include managing the growing civic space , without risking instability , and effectively addressing socioeconomic challenges . 14 . The UNDP rapid integrated assessment of the NDP , 2018-2022 , revealed that overall alignment to Sustainable Development Goals-related targets is at 52 per cent . More investment in acceleration is particularly needed for Goals 1 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 14 and 15 . The INE published the first national baseline indicators report for the Goals in 2018 , reporting on 41 per cent of total Goals indicators . Additional efforts are needed to improve access and quality of statistical information and promote a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach to monitor implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . The voluntary national review of Angola will contribute to this . 15 . Over the last three years , the UNDP country office has undergone a major transformation and is , at the start of the next country programme , a convener of multiple partners for the Goals and Agenda 2030 .
