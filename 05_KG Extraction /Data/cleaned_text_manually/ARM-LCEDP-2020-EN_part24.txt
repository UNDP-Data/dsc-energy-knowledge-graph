Because the Government of Armenia has not yet put in place any obligatory requirements for implementation of energy efficiency activities , the market uptake of Improved , Better and Advanced technologies is constrained . The common assumption on the upper limit of “ Improved ” technologies for Agriculture , Commercial , Industry and Residential sectors is 10 % . In addition , the Agriculture sector is allowed to change existing technologies by “ Best ” ( 10 % ) and “ Advanced ” ( 10 % ) , the Commercial sector by “ Advanced ” ( 2.5 % ) , and the Residential sector by “ Best ” ( 5 % ) and “ Advanced ” ( 2.5 % ) . For the Industrial sector neither “ Best ” nor “ Advanced ” technologies are allowed , while for the Transport sector , implementation of all new technologies types are limited to 10 % , based on the relatively limited retrospective data available for Armenia , combined with expert review and judgement of available experience by the DWG and SRIE team . # 3.5 MAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE INITIAL UNCONSTRAINED BASELINE SCENARIO Summarizing the key model assumptions as detailed in the sections above , we note in particular :  GDP growth is assumed constant after 2022 , at the level of 4.5 % per year ( sensitivities to higher or lower rates will be examined in subsequent scenarios ) ;  While population is assumed to have a small negative growth rate , thus slightly decreasing over the planning period , residential demand for useful energy still grows on average by 1.7 % annually ;  The commercial sector is the main contributor to demand for useful energy , with average annual growth of over 4.4 % ;  The agriculture and industrial sectors contribute less to the growth of demand for useful energy , with average annual growth rates of around 0.2 % and 2.2 % , respectively ;  The gas price is assumed to increase , reaching the European prices level in 2027 ( US $ 299/1000 m3 ) and growing at the same rate thereafter ;  Electricity losses are assumed to maintain a total of 8.2 % for transmission and distribution systems ;  Net electricity exports to South are held constant at the 2018 level ( 1,515.2 GWh ) for the planning horizon ; net electricity imports from Georgia and from Artsakhenergo are assumed to remain unchanged at their 2018 levels , 74.5 GWh and 17.2 GWh respectively , for the planning horizon ;  Both the Yerevan CCGT2 ( RENCO ) thermal plant and the Masrik-1 grid connected solar PV plant , which are already financed and have set Commercial Operation Dates are introduced in the system at those dates ; and  No other technical limitations are imposed on the introduction of new power generation candidate technologies in the system for the planning horizon . ; # 3.6 SUMMARY RESULTS OF
