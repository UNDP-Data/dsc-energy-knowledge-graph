Policies and Strategies for Industry and Energy ● Monitoring existing operations with a view of either rejuvenating them or bringing them to a realistic termination , including environmental remediation ; ● Planning for the national supply and demand for petroleum products : Procurement , Quality Control , Emergency Stockpiling , Product Distribution and the respective taxes ( which will have impact on pricing ) ; ● Planning for ongoing modern exploration and development of the national petroleum endowment ; ● Utilization of the industry to bring foreign direct investment funds , enhance technology transfer , infrastructure development , job creation , training and utilization of domestic goods and services . ; # Directorate of Development Programs of Industry and Energy ● Anticipating , formulating , adopting , executing , monitoring the policy related to natural gas ; ● Monitoring existing operations with a view of either rejuvenating them or bringing them to a realistic termination , including environmental remediation ; ● Planning for the national supply and demand for gas : Procurement , guaranty of necessary quantities , and establish conditions for transmission of these quantities , taking into the consideration feasibility for the consumers . ; ● Planning for utilization of natural gas off-take from the TAP pipeline ; ● Utilization of the industry to bring foreign direct investment funds , enhance technology transfer , infrastructure development , job creation , training and utilization of domestic goods and services ; # 3.8.4 ALBPETROL ALBPETROL is a wholly government-owned , vertically integrated oil company that has the exclusive rights for the development of all oil and gas fields . Most of the oil production over which ALBPETROL has production rights , has been contracted out to foreign companies of which nearly 60 % is exported for refining into products elsewhere . Albania ’ s yet-to-be-discovered reserves of oil and gas , both offshore and onshore , are believed to be significant , but their exploration will require the use of sophisticated technologies which are not locally available . Programs must therefore be developed to present these opportunities to the international oil industry in a structured fashion as a means of converting them into tools of economic development for Albania . The petroleum sector in Albania faces significant challenges in both the upstream and downstream . In the upstream , there has been a steep decline in production since the 1970s and 1980s , largely owing to the lack of investment in exploration . Albania 's existing and potential hydrocarbon resource makes c1ear that there is significant potential for Albania to achieve considerable economic benefit from more extensive and intensive petroleum exploration and development . Albania 's two major petroleum basins , which have thus far produced 429 million barrels of oil equivalent ( MMboe ) , hold another 467 MMboe in proven and probable recoverable reserves and also have estimated potential from yet undiscovered fields of 718 MMboe . All above mentioned figures are based on the declared figures of
