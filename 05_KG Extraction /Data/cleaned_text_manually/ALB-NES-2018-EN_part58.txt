Increasing hydropower energy supply to 7,300 GWh/annum by 2020 ( from 4,425 GWh in 2012 ) , ;  Reducing electricity losses in the distribution network to 14 % by 2020 , ;  Reducing energy dependency in imports to 65 % in 2020 ( from 69.75 % in 2015 ) , ;  Start operation on the second half of 2018 of the 400 kV interconnection line between Albania and Kosovo ( completed in 2016 ) with the assistance of the Energy Community Secretariat and European Commission . ;  Strengthen interconnection of electricity networks with Kosovo and Macedonia to improve the linkage of the Albanian energy system with the region . , ;  Aligning the electricity sector ’ s legal and regulatory framework with the EU Acquis and meeting the obligations of the Third Energy Package . ;  Regional market coupling ; In order to meet its obligations with the Third Energy package and further promote and sustain its economic development , Albania is taking steps to remain attractive financially and economically in the energy sector . While being one of the first Contracting Parties to begin transposing the Third Energy Package in the electricity sector , Albania ’ s electricity sector is characterized by a market structure in which most of the energy procurement is dominated by bilateral transactions for large customers , while most of the other customers and the retail market remains operated under a regulatory regime . Positively , the unbundling of operations and interests is underway , and the one positive aspect in the transmission ownership was adopted by law in 2016 . OST , the certified transmission system operator central to the development of a robust market , is tasked to ensure quality development of the transmission grid , while ensuring transparent and non-discriminatory grid access for market participants . It must also coordinate the planning and development of the transmission network with counterpart companies in the region . As part of its effort to strengthen its transmission network , Albania has initiated several improvement projects within the country such as for the mid-term ( 2017-2021 ) :  Extension of Komani substation with 400/220 kV autotransformer 345 MVA and its connection to the grid . ;  Construction of 400/110 kV Tirana3 Substations 2x150 MVA , Strenthening of 110 kV Tirana ring network and Construction of double circuit 220 kV line Tirana2 Ss- Rashbull Ss . ;  Construction of 400 kV interconnection line Fier Ss - Elbasan2 Ss - Bitola Ss , rehabilitation of Elbasan2 Ss and extention of Fier Ss with 400/220 kV autotransformer 400 MVA . ;  Construction of 220 kV line Burrel – Peshkopi and 220/110 kV Peshkopi Ss 120 MVA . ;  Installation of a Shunt Reactor 400 kV , 120 MVAR in 400 kV Zemblak Ss busbars . ;  Purchase and implementation of a new electronic platform for the energy Management ; Long term plans for the transmission network will
