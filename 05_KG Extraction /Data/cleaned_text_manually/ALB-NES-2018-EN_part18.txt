Energy Community Contracting Parties and neighboring EU member states in South East Europe . # 3.3 RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO Based upon the strategic metric results , the detailed analysis shows that the most beneficial development scenario for the Albanian energy sector would be to implement all the measures from the EE , RES and Albania-Kosovo electricity market coupling scenarios along with the power and industry sector components of the Natural Gas Promotion scenario by removing the gas infrastructure investment required to serve residential and commercial customers . The recommended development scenario is considered the most beneficial because it has the potential to achieve the following results :  Potential to reduce the energy imports by 32 % compared to the Baseline scenario ;  Potential to reach the RES target past 2020 by including the gas infrastructure investment to serve the power and industry sectors and not at the middle terms to the residential and commercial customers ;  Potential to reduce the final energy demand by 19.4 % , compared to the Baseline scenario ;  Potential to reduce the GHG emissions by 28 % compared to the Baseline scenario ;  Potential to reduce the electricity generation requirements by at least 31 % , and ;  Potential that natural gas to penetrate up to 19.81 % of the total primary energy source by 2030 ;  Potential to reduce the reduce the energy intensity of GDP by 18 % ; Implementing this Energy Strategy will increase the security of Albania ’ s energy supply and begin to integrate the Albanian energy market into regional and European markets . This Strategy is based on an optimal energy scenario that balances national interests with those of the different energy sub-sectors . In addition , the strategy is designed to create equal conditions for all energy companies engaged in the Albanian energy market , increase the welfare , and minimize adverse impacts on the environment . # 3.4 KEY POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS Albania is in the process of developing and implementing a number of key laws and regulations that will have an impact on the role of main stakeholders in the power sector , and in the area of energy efficiency as well as climate action . This chapter summarizes the key areas of reform , sets out the implications for the role of both existing and new energy sector institutions , and identifies gaps between the actual situation and what is expected to be achieved after the successful implementation of the reforms . # 3.4.1 POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM DRIVERS The main drivers of reform in the power sector reforms include :  The Energy Community Treaty ( “ ECT ” ) , ratified by the Albanian Parliament with Law No.9501 , dated 3.04.2006 , which provides a legal framework for convergence with the European Union ’ s ( “ EU ” ) energy acquis8 ;  Law No . 43/2015 “ On Power Sector ” , which
