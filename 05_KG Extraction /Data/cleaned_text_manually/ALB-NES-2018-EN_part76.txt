Table 21 shows the cumulative investment required from these sources for each energy sector . # Private Investment and Donor Financing 2018 – 2030 ( MEUR ) in MEUR Power Sector ( EE Scenario ) Generation 1149 ; Power Sector ( EE Scenario ) Transmission 107.1 ; Power Sector ( EE Scenario ) Distribution 231 ; Power Sector ( EE Scenario ) Subtotal 1488.1 ; Natural Gas SectorInterconnection 230.0 ; Natural Gas Sector Transmission and Distribution 117.0 ; Natural Gas Sector Subtotal 347.0 ; Oil Sector Exploration and Production of Crude Oil 162.4 ; Oil Sector Rehabilitation of Ballsh & Fier Refineries 24 ; Oil Sector Improvements of downstream oil by products infrastructure 65 ; Oil Sector Construction of New Refineries , 350 ; Oil Sector Subtotal 601.4 ; Awareness Campaigns and Pilot Projects Promotion of EE 0 ; Awareness Campaigns and Pilot Projects Promotion of RES 0 ; Awareness Campaigns and Pilot Projects Subtotal 0 ; Total 2,436.5 ; Private investment and Donors financing account for almost 91.6 % of the total required investments . # 5 . ACCOUNTABILITY , MONITORING AND EVALUATION # 5.1 INTRODUCTION Implementation of the National Energy Strategy is a very significant undertaking for Albania , requiring consistent and meaningfully applied political will , coordination of all energy related stakeholders within the country , and cooperation with Albania ’ s development partners .
