600 million of investment to ensure safety and reliability ;  Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 300 MW ( Small Modular Reactor - SMR ) ;  Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 600 MW ( Light Water Reactor - LWR ) . ; A surprising but crucial result of these sensitivity analyses is that the model projects no differences in total new power plant capacities in level or by type required to cover electricity demand over the full range of GDP growth variation , with only slight variations in the implementation schedule for new solar , wind and hydro power depending on the required consumption level in each time period . Thus , there is virtually no impact as well on the investment requirement for new electricity generation capacity as compared to the BASER scenario . The only effect of higher ( lower ) income growth lies in the increased ( decreased ) utilization of existing installed capacity of both VRES and gas-fired thermal power plants , with a concomitant increase ( decrease ) in expenditures on natural gas fuel . Given this key result , no further detailed sensitivity analyses of the impacts of higher and lower growth rates was reported for any of the other scenarios . in BASE-R , decrease total system cost by around 1 % , increase TPES by 3.7 % and 7.3 % , reduce GHG emissions significantly by 4.5 % and 9.3 % and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 11.8 % and 20.4 % , respectively . A key feature of these scenarios is that they increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity 15.1 % and 12.5 % , compared the BASE-R scenario , with the higher investment costs for the longer extension being offset in its impact on total investment by the fact that in this scenario neither of the mid-sized HPPs ( Shnokh and Loriberd ) is built . The scenarios which propose new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 with either a 300 MW SMR or a 600 MW LWR increase total system cost by around 2 % , increase TPES by 3.3 % and 7.8 % , reduce GHG emissions significantly by 7.1 % and 12.2 % , and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 7.2 % and 15.5 % , respectively . A key impact in these scenarios is that they significantly increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity compared the BASE-R scenario , more than doubling it to $ 4.1 billion ( a 116 % increase ) for the 300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $ 5 billion ( a 164 % increase ) for the 600 MW LWR unit . Whether considering total system cost or investment costs required for new generation , the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP represent a least-cost policy choice for continuing to maintain
