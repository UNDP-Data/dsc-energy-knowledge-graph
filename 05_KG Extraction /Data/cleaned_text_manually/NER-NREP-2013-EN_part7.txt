. It also illustrates the country ’ s vulnerability to climate shocks and the importance of managing water resources to sustain development . Niger ’ s growth is attributed to an exceptionally dynamic secondary sector , which grew by almost 38 % in 2012 driven by the extractive industries . Niger commenced oil production in late 2011 in a joint venture with the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) . As part of this plan , a new refinery has been built with a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day . The emergence of oil on the Nigerien economic landscape has triggered new optimism concerning the country ’ s future development and balance of trade management . The economy is dominated by agriculture , forestry and livestock , which contribute 43 % of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) and employ about 80 % of the country ’ s workforce ( IMF , 2013 ) . Given the country ’ s location in the Sahel region , these sectors are highly vulnerable to climate variability , leading to frequent droughts and affecting productivity . Service and commercial sectors are also major contributors to the economy , accounting for 41 % of GDP . Although it is a fast growing sector with significant potential , heavy industry accounts for only 16 % of GDP . Uranium , gold , coal and limestone are the principal products mined , contributing 6.3 % of GDP in 2011 . With the emergence of oil production as a major activity , exports from the extractive industries are expected to double by 2016 compared to 2011 . Manufacturing has also increased its share to about 6 % in 2011 , largely in the domain of food processing ( AEO , 2013 ) . AfDB states that flows of Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) exceeded USD 1 billion ( bn ) in 2011 and remained high in 2012 at about USD 830m . Much of the investment was in the mining and oil sectors . Over the past two decades , Niger ’ s social indicators have improved noticeably . The gross primary school enrolment rate has increased from about 29 % in the early 1990s to 76 % in 2011 . The ratio of girls to boys in primary schools also increased from 25 % to 40 % during the same period , and further improvements are expected . The mortality rate for children under five has fallen from 320 to 130 per thousand in 1990-2010 ( World Bank , 2013b ) . However , major challenges remain , as all development indicators point to very low human and economic development according to the United Nations Development Programme ( United Nations Development Programme UNDP , 2013 ) . Niger is currently ranked 186th on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) . Nearly 76 % of the population lives on less than two dollars a day and is experiencing extreme poverty . Improving living
