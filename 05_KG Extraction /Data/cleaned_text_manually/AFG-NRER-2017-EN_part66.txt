; • set up along the lines of AISA with overlapping functions to DABS ; • to catalyse and foster growth of RET ( solar and wind ) based power parks , and IPPs in collaboration with private sector ; • would act as a single-window clearance for future IPPs ; Rural electrification agency • Promote rural electrification projects , specifically mini-grids through site selection , land acquisition , access to finance , and regulatory approvals ; • set up along the lines of DABS , but would set up generation and distribution of electricity in rural areas only ; • shall support local enterprises as RESCO as distribution franchisees of DABS ; • serve to minimize risk to private sector ’ s engagement in rural electrification ; • shall work in close collaboration with ministries and departments serving rural population and requiring energy services ; Financing institution for clean energy sector • a dedicated and empowered institution to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency projects ; • facilitating a basket-fund approach ; • ensuring ring-fencing of funds for clean energy sector ; • shall provide debt and equity to project promoters and developers ; • can also extend financial support by way of conditional grants and last-stage equity that can provide viabilitygap financing ; • be able to raise funds through internal as well as external markets ; The above institutions are governed and guided by the government Ministries which are primarily policy and law-making authorities . There are good examples from the region that have served the purposes as described above . Some of these are Infrastructure Development Company Limited ( IDCOL ) , Bangladesh ; Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency ( IREDA ) , India ; Solar Energy Corporation of India ( SECI ) , India ; and Alternate Energy Promotion Centre ( AEPC ) , Nepal . # 7.3 Projects To meet the targets of the RENP , it is imperative to find success on the ground with projects that are implemented in the ‘ first stage ’ of the Roadmap . The second focus area shall therefore be the development of strategically important and trendsetting projects in addition to priority sectors outlined in Roadmap . 1 Solar power park De-risking deployment of utility-scale wind and solar projects by Identifying suitable sites , providing infrastructure for evacuation and security , and streamlining regulatory clearance . SPPs may be set up by DABS as the SPPD , and eventually owned by private sector partners ; 2 Mini-grids with RESCO model A cluster of mini-grid projects to be developed and bid out either individually or collectively following the RESCO business model ; 4 Solar hot water systems for institutions As an effective demand-side-management strategy to reduce electricity generation requirements , while offering potential for economic development through local manufacture , SHWS to be promoted in a programmatic mode ; 5 Kabul roof-top solar Following the maturity and proven viability of this market globally , Kabul roof-top solar pilot
