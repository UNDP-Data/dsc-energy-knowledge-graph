to ensure timely publication of the Sri Lanka Energy Balance . 3.8.9 Indices which can assist the understanding of energy sector trends will be identified and included in national statistics to help evidence-based decision making . 3.8.10 Active engagement of citizens in the energy sector will be promoted using web portals linked to applications for mobile phones , leading to awareness creation , grievance handling and education , targeting the closure of trust deficit , greater acceptance of energy sector projects , user safety and improved end-user behaviour of energy services . 3.9 Securing Land for Future Energy Infrastructure Considering limitation to land with specific attributes that are required to develop certain technologies and considering the extensive financial losses incurred in the past owing to shifting of sites to locate power plants , strategic locations to establish future energy infrastructure will be earmarked and secured in advance to ensure timely implementation of such facilities and to minimise adverse social impacts , employing the strategies : 3.9.1 Suitable sites to locate future energy infrastructure such as coal , natural gas and nuclear power plants , refineries and terminals will be strategically earmarked in advance following preliminary feasibility studies , so that the public can avoid using such sites , resulting in minimal relocation and social impacts at the time of actual development . 3.9.2 Best sites to locate large scale renewable energy infrastructure such as wind and solar farms would be identified in advance and marked on a master plan so that they can be developed as large concentrated facilities in phases . 3.9.3 Corridors for petroleum and gas pipe transport and for backbone electricity transmission would be identified , giving priority to shared corridors for the benefit of national infrastructure planning . Identified routes would be published for the purpose of giving advance information to the public . 3.9.4 Available corridors will be used to lay multiple pipelines and power transmission lines wherever possible . 3.9.5 All existing and future underground utility infrastructure including electricity , water , communication , town gas and petroleum would be made available in a common mandatory geographic information system ( GIS ) to facilitate optimal location of future underground cable routes and pipe transport traces . 3.9.6 Roadside utility infrastructure corridors including electricity distribution , sewer , water , communication and gas supply shall be coordinated with transport infrastructure , in such a manner that clear demarcation of ownership , flexibility of maintenance , and room for expansion would be ensured . 3.10 Providing Opportunities for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Considering the limitation to the scale of markets available in Sri Lanka to breed technology intensive local businesses , the relative vastness of the energy sector will be utilised to nurture local entrepreneurship and innovation by actively engaging the strategies : 3.10.1 Electricity will be recognised as the dominant energy carrier of the future , and strategic ventures to utilise local resources in energy conversion and storage equipment will be nurtured as an industrialisation thrust
