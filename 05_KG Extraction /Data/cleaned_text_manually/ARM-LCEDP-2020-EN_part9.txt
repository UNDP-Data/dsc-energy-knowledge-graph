Hrazdan Thermal Power Plan ( TPP ) , 810 and 370 ; Hrazdan Unit 5 TPP , 480 and 440 ; Yerevan Combined Cycle Gas Turbine , 242 and 220 Sevan-Hrazdan Hydro Power Plant ( HPP ) Cascade , 560 and 560 ; Vorotan HPP Cascade , 404 and 404 ; Small Hydropower Producers ( < 30 MW ) , 328 and 328 ; Wind Farm , 2.64 and 2.64 ; TOTAL , 3,267 and 2,710 ; The first unit of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant ( ANPP ) was put into operation in 1976 and the second unit in 1980 . Two reactors of the type VVER-440 ( V-270 ) were installed , with an aggregate capacity of 815 MW . Following the Spitak earthquake on December 7 , 1988 , operation of the ANPP stopped for safety considerations , although there was no technical damage to the plant . As a consequence of the severe energy crisis in Armenia during the years 1993-95 , the ANPP Unit No . 2 was re-commissioned in 1995 with an installed capacity of 440 MW . In 2016 , the available capacity of ANPP was 385 MW . The installed capacity of all hydropower plants ( HPPs ) in Armenia in 2016 was 1,293 MW , including 328 MW of small HPPs ( size less than 30 MW ) . All the rivers of Armenia are in the Kura-Araks Basin , with 73.5 % of the territory of Armenia in the Araks river basin . There are more than 200 rivers and streams in Armenia with a length of 10 km or more . The Hrazdan River , flowing out of Lake Sevan , and the Araks , Vorotan , and Debet Rivers have the most energy potential . According to the former Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources , the potential water energy resources of Armenia are 21.8 billion kWh , including 18.6 billion kWh from large and medium-sized rivers , and 3.2 billion kWh from small rivers . Armenia ’ s hydropower resources are the country ’ s most widely used renewable energy resource . The main hydropower generation units in Armenia in 2016 were :  Sevan-Hrazdan HPP Cascade : The cascade comprises seven HPPs : Sevan ( 34 MW ) ; Hrazdan ( 81 MW ) ; Argel ( 224 MW ) ; Arzni ( 70 MW ) ; Kanaker ( 102 MW ) ; Yerevan-1 ( 44 MW ) ; and Yerevan-3 ( 5 MW ) , with a total installed capacity of 560 MW and designed to produce up to 2.32 billion kWh annually . The HPPs are all located on the Hrazdan River and use irrigation water flow from Lake Sevan and other tributaries of the Hrazdan River . ;  Vorotan HPP Cascade : The cascade consists of three HPPs , all located on the Vorotan River in the territory of Syunik , which utilize both the river and stream waters .
