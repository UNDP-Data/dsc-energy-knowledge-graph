USD 0.20/kWh and USD 0.24/kWh for the PV and diesel options respectively . It is worth noting here that the cost of diesel for electrification at USD 0.75/litre is below the pump selling price in Niger ( USD 1.076 ) and the African average . This is at about USD 1.20/litre ( World Bank , 2013c ) . An analysis against diesel costs shows that if prices increase in line with the selling price and average African levels , the levelised cost of generation using diesel rises sharply . However , the likely changes are relatively smooth and therefore easier to manage and adapt ( figure 17 ) . Of course , PV prices are also falling rapidly , and if further reductions are experienced in the market , the cost of PV generation only becomes more attractive . The government ’ s import tariff at 52 % will need to be reviewed so that Niger can fully benefit from global price changes . Important new players are also entering the PV market , and their involvement and reach could be beneficial . Telecommunications companies such as Airtel and Orange fall into this category . In order to reduce their oil bill and improve the reliability of services , both Airtel and Orange are investing in solar PV to power their sites off the mains . By 2011 , Airtel had equipped its 170 sites with PV ; each site consisted of 36 panels ( 185 Wp each ) for a system size of 6.7 kW per site . Airtel has thus far installed a total of 1.132 MW PV capacity . Prior to this initiative , all these sites used diesel and each had a monthly consumption of 1,500 litres . This amounted to 18,000 litres p.a . Migration to solar PV enables Airtel to save USD 16,700 per site or USD 2.84m p.a . The cost of the equipment amounts to USD 100,000 per site , so there is a payback period of about 5.5 years . Orange started making a similar move in 2009 . Currently , 250 sites located in remote areas are powered by solar PV with an installed capacity of 11 kW per site . The cost of the equipment by site is about USD 90,000 and replaces 600 litres of diesel consumption per month . Savings amount to USD 6,600 per site p.a . or about USD 1.7m for all 250 sites . The company ’ s target is to reach 25 % solar PV penetration in its overall energy consumption . The emergence of these powerful commercial players in the PV market indicates that the technology is reliable and low cost for generating electricity . It could go some way to helping the PV sector achieve some degree of visibility and credibility . They can also be useful partners in communicating the technology as a serious , mature alternative to be taken seriously by policy makers and the general public . #
