investment requirements by 15 % , while life extension to 2037 increases these costs by 12 % , reflecting both the assumed additional $ 300 million and $ 600 million of further investment beyond the current program of safety upgrades , respectively , for these extensions and the fact that the longer life extension eliminates the investment required for both the mid-sized HPPs , Shnokh and Loriberd . The options to build a new nuclear replacement for the ANPP increase system investment costs significantly compared to the BASE-R scenario , with the SMR 300 MW requiring just over twice as much investment ( an added $ 2.2 billion ) and the LWR 600 MW scenario requiring an additional $ 3.1 billion . Finally , the model results confirm that replacing gas fired generation by nuclear power will tend to reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions in the system as compared to the BASE-R scenario , by a range from 4.5 % to 12.2 % as shown in Table 4.17 . # 4.3 NATURAL GAS PRICE FROM RUSSIA LOWER THAN EUROPEAN # 4.3.1 SCENARIO DESCRIPTION The BASE-R scenario assumed that the natural gas price will increase up to projected European levels by 2027 and after that continue to match European levels . Historically Armenia has negotiated gas prices with Russia below these European rates . In this section , the following two scenario versions are presented for trends of natural gas prices lower than European as compared to the BASE-R scenario , in all cases starting from the same initial border gas price effective from January 1 , 2019 , of US $ 165 per 1000 m3 : • EU trend rate to 2036 : Rather than imposing the higher initial growth of gas prices required to reach the European level in 2027 , this scenario simply applies the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036. ; • Growth to $ 180 by 2027 : In this scenario , the border gas prices is assumed to grow to US $ 180 per 1000 m3 by 2027 , and then to remain fixed at that level until the end of the planning period . ( note : 2027 is the indicative year as this is the timing for currently- planned shutdown of the ANPP ) . ; It should be noted that in all scenarios it is assumed that the current gas transmission/distribution/supply margin does not change . Figure 4.12 below shows the modelled natural gas border prices for each milestone year . # 4.3.2 LOWER GAS PRICE TREND SCENARIO RESULTS As shown in Table 4.18 , the total system cost is estimated to decrease by around 3.8 % in the EU trend to 2036 scenario and by around 5.6 % in scenario with gas price capped at US $ 180 per 1000 m3 after 2027 compared to the BASE-R scenario . Given the fact that gas plays such a predominant role in the Armenian energy balance ,
