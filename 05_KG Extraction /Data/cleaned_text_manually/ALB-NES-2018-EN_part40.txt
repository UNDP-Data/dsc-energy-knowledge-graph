from such cooperation . ; # 3.10.3 SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN BUILDINGS SECTOR # BUILDING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS Support mechanisms to improve energy efficiency in the buildings sector are different for public buildings , commercial buildings and households . Taking into account the mechanisms applied in EU Member States , the following suggestions could be used for Albania :  In additions to EE Fund it is very important to investigate other financing mechanisms , including preferential loans , grants , subsides and third party financing , which are recommended rather than fiscal mechanisms ;  Financing of energy efficiency measures in central and municipal public buildings should be organized by the government in close collaboration with local authorities . Improvements in the energy efficiency of public buildings and public street lighting may be financed from grants that are still provided by IFIs and PPP model/ESCO projects . Grants and soft loans should be sought from IFIs for specific activities . PPP model/ESCO projects typically include detailed energy auditing , technical design , implementation and monitoring and verification of the results ( energy and cost savings , cost and energy indicators ) ;  Improvements in the energy efficiency of commercial buildings should be financed by preferential loans from existing guarantee funds such as the EBRD Sustainable Energy Fund ( SEF ) Programme ( under Western Balkan Sustainable Energy Programme ) . Implementation of Western Balkans Green Economy Financing Facility ( WB GEFF - Residential ) in the Western Balkans , focusing on the residential sector through the EBRD is supporting Residential sector with grants for all projects that reach 20 % energy savings or 20 % reduction of CO2 emissions . Albania will be included in this scheme during the year 2017 and the program will continue until 2020 . Energy audits and technical advice are already granted from EBRD Western Balkan Sustainable Energy Direct Financing Facility ( WeBSEDFF ) program through financial support provided by the EBRD/EU ;  Some external financing for commercial building energy efficiency is also available in the form of preferential loans ( which include incentive payments ) combined with technical assistance energy audits provided free of charge for the borrower ) launched by IFC , GGF and from private banks with their internal funds ;  Financial support to improve the energy efficiency of households should combine awareness , technical advice and information , and preferential loans for EE investments from an established list . ;  Financing of low income households should focus on low cost measures and technical advice which will be subsidized either from a state budget allocation or from local authority budgets and by redirected subsidies from energy utilities to end-users ; # SOLAR WATER HEATING INCENTIVES The following financial and fiscal measures for promotion of solar hot water technologies should be further investigated and recommended to be followed to maintain the momentum of such technology use in residential , commercial and public buildings as well as in some
