CARRIERS IN 2016 , KTOE Brown coal 0.7 ; Lubricants 6.2 ; Anthracite 0.6 ; Paraffin Waxes 0.4 ; Liquefied petroleum gases ( LPG ) 4.5 ; Bitumen 22.2 ; Motor Gasoline excl . bio 146.7 ; Other oil products 3 ; Gasoline type jet fuel 0.0 ; Natural Gas 1,847.4 ; White spirit & SBP 0.1 ; Fire wood 0.0 ; Kerosene Type Jet Fuel excl . bio 44.8 ; Solid biomass 6.0 ; Other Kerosene 7.6 ; Other biomass 0.2 ; Gas/Diesel Oil excl . bio 121.3 ; Electricity 23.7 ; Fuel Oil 0.3 ; TOTAL 2,235.7 ; Finally , considering FEC by demand sector in 2016 , the total FEC amounted to 2,094.6 kilotons of oil equivalent ( ktoe ) , out of which the amount for households and transport together were just over 1,400 ktoe . The base year data outline the leading position of households , which accounted for 37 % of total FEC , with transport second at almost 30 % . In the base year , services and industry accounted for 15.6 % and 15.3 % of FEC , respectively , while agriculture had the smallest share in total FEC at 2 % . Figure 1.7 shows all final energy consumption by sectors and types of fuel in 2016 . Additional details on the composition of FEC in the base year are found in Appendix 1 . # 1.5 ENERGY COSTS IN 2016 Electricity and gas were fully regulated sectors in 2016 and the PSRC was responsible for setting tariffs . # 1.5.1 ELECTRICTY TARIFFS FOR CONSUMERS Electricity tariffs for consumers were differentiated by day and night , as presented in Table 1.7 . There was no differentiation by consumer types ( e.g . industry , services , etc . ) , but only by connection voltage . There was also a special tariff class for poor consumers . # 1.5.2 ELECTRICITY GENERATION TARIFFS Tariffs for large electricity generation companies are shown in Table 1.8 . These rates have a capacity and an electricity ( energy ) component . The capacity tariff is a payment that does not depend on the amount of electricity generated , while the electricity tariff is used for payment on kWh of electricity produced . To support development of renewable energy resources , the PSRC had also set feed-in tariffs , as presented in # ELECTRICITY GENERATION TARIFFS : RENEWABLES ( VAT EXCLUDED , EFFECTIVE FROM FEBRUARY 1 , 2017 ) Except for small HPPs , all other renewables had a VAT-inclusive generation tariff ( 51.29 AMD/kWh ) set higher than the highest tariff for consumers ( 44.98 AMD/kWh with VAT ; Table 1.7 ) . Small HPPs Built on drinking water pipeline , 10.579 ( 2.192 ) AMD ( US cents ) /kWh ; Small HPPs Built on irrigation system , 15.867 ( 3.287 ) AMD ( US cents ) /kWh ; Small HPPs Built on natural water flow , 23.805 ( 4.932 ) AMD ( US
