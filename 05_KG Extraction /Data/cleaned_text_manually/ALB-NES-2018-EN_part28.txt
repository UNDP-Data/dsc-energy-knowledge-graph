Albania is one of the transit countries for the Trans Adriatic Pipeline , which will carry Azeri gas across Greece , through Albania , to Italy . By the end of 2020 , the pipeline should give Albania access to natural gas for domestic use . The new pipeline will also connect Albania to the much larger economies of Greece and Italy , both of whom are important trading partners and sources of investment . Albania ’ s state-owned oil company ALBPETROL estimates Albania ’ s proven oil reserves at roughly 220 million barrels and natural gas reserves at approximately 5.7 billion m3 gas . Currently , nine companies hold Production Sharing Agreements ( PSA ) with the state-owned oil company ALBPETROL for development and production in the existing oil fields . Patos Marinza - Bankers Petroleum ( 2004 ) ; Ballsh Hekal – Continental Oil and Gas ( 2016 ) ; Cakran Mollaj - Albpetrol ; Gorisht Koculit - Albpetrol ; Delvina – Global Energy Management ( 2016 ) ; Kucova - Sherwood International Petroleum ( 2007 ) ; Visoka - Transoil Group ( 2009 ) ; Amonica – Albpetrol , Drashovica , Finiq-Karne and Pekisht-Murriz – Phoenix Petroleum ( 2013 ) ; and Divjake , Ballaj-Kryevidh , Povelce , Panaja and Frakull – Phoenix Petroleum ( 2013 ) . As a result , heavy crude oil production in Albania has tripled over the last decade to 1.29 million tons in 2015 ,
