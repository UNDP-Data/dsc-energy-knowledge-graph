in the Parliament , which will create the legal basis for the establishment of the Albanian Power Exchange and market coupling with Kosovo . Following the obligations stipulated therein , the Energy Regulatory Entity ( ERE ) and the Ministry of Energy and Industry started the process of harmonizing the secondary legislation required for the reforms and liberalization of the electricity market . In March 2017 , ERE approved the final certification of the ownership unbundling of the electricity system operator , OST . The electricity market reforms will go beyond the implementation of the Third Energy Package inside the country . Albania is a member of the Berlin process or Western Balkans Six ( WB6 ) initiative and has committed to regional electricity market integration as an intermediary step toward a European electricity target model . Further , as a part of WB6 initiative Albania has committed to climate action . In July 2016 , the Council of Ministers adopted a new market model for the regulation of Albania â€™ s electricity market .

At present Albpetrol 's primary source of revenue is the overriding royalties or share of profit it obtains from private oil and gas companies . These are functions that should be performed by a government agency , rather than Albpetrol . Hence , Albania today has , in effect , two government agencies overseeing the oil and gas sector , with the more appropriate agency for this role ( AKBN ) having been substantially weakened . The other players in Albania 's upstream market are private companies that have obtained rights over existing oil and gas fields as well as new exploration and production . Albania 's ad-hoc licensing approach has resulted in a predominance of small companies operating in
