, in this section we examine and present the results only for a targeted 25 % improvement of energy efficiency . # 4.6.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCENARIO RESULTS This scenario has been modeled to force a 25 % reduction in total of final energy consumption ( FEC ) across all demand sectors by 2036 . Table 4.41 shows that as a result of primary energy savings the overall system cost will decrease by around 4.3 % , savings roughly equal to US $ 1.8 billion . As will be detailed further below this arises mostly due to fuel costs savings , for although the new higher efficiency technologies which are forced in implementation may have higher investment costs , their reduced use of fuel leads to this overall total system cost reduction . Table 4.42 shows that in reaching the target of 25 % reduced FEC by 2036 , TPES over the entire planning period is reduced by 10 % , or 314 PJ , which arises principally from reduced demand for gas and oil products due to the increase in combined efficiency of demand devices used throughout the economy . As illustrated in Figure 4.26 below , this reduction in TPES reflects key changes in the composition of energy supply as compared to the BASE-R scenario , in particular through a significant reduction of natural gas use - cumulatively at 248.9 PJ for a 17.1 % reduction , equivalent to 7,136.6 billion m3 - and of oil products , equal to 66.2 PJ for a 27.7 % reduction over the planning horizon . There is also 5.2 % reduction of biofuel supply , which arises after 2030 and saves around 0.12 PJ in total . Beside the reduction of all fossil fuels , use of renewable energy sources in TPES grows by 2.2 % , or 0.35 PJ , reflecting the attractiveness of these carbon-free technologies to achieve the FEC reduction targets . Table 4.43 below shows that achieving a 25 % reduction of FEC by 2036 will cumulatively save around 12.6 % of consumed energy over the entire planning horizon , approximately 302 PJ . Figure 4.27 below shows that while the main energy carrier used remains natural gas , followed by electricity and oil products , most energy savings come from reduced consumption of natural gas , cumulatively amounting to around 240 PJ , around 79 % of total savings , and from reduced consumption of oil products equal to 66 PJ , around 22 % of savings . Figure 4.28 illustrates how these savings in FEC are distributed among the end-use sectors , showing that the Transportation , Residential and Commercial sectors all offer significant energy saving potential , amounting to 125 PJ , 105PJ and 71 PJ , respectively . As shown in Table 4.44 , in order to cover the slight growth of electricity use in this scenario there is no need for additional new power generation capacity , as compared to the BASE-R scenario
