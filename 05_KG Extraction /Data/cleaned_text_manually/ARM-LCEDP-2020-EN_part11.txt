18 110 kV substations ) . The Armenia power system has interconnections with all neighbor countries , although those with Turkey and Azerbaijan were not in operation , due to political issues . Currently , construction of new 400 kV HVL both toward the North and the South is planned , which will expand opportunities both for exchange to neighboring power systems and to establish electricity transit among them . Electricity generated by power plants and transmitted by HVL reaches consumers through the distribution network , which comprises 110 – 35 - 6 ( 10 ) - 0.4 kV lines and cables . The number of distribution customers in 2016 was close to 985,000 , all served by the sole distribution company “ Electric Networks of Armenia ” CJSC . The distribution network consisted of 2,778 km of lines and 102 substations at the 110 kV level ; 2,307 km of overhead and 68 km of cable lines and 224 substations at the 35 kV level ; and 20,917 km of overhead and 5,666 km of cable lines and 8,162 substations at the 6 ( 10 ) and 0.4 kV levels . Figure 1.4 shows the share of electricity consumption by economic sectors in 2016 , using the terminology for sectors of the Public Services Regulatory Commission ( PSRC ) . Three sectors account for over 90 % of electricity consumption , with “ Population ” ( i.e. , Residential ) as the largest at 35 % of the total , followed by “ Others ” ( comprising the Service/Commercial sector ) at 30 % , and Industry at 26 % . The Transport sector only accounts for 2 % of electricity consumption , although as will be seen it is a large consumer of final use energy . Clearly , in terms of understanding and projecting demand growth for electricity , these three sectors will be a key focus for in-depth modelling . # 1.3 NATURAL GAS IMPORTS , SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION IN 2016 Data for the main indicators of the natural gas supply system for 2016 are summarized in Table 1.3 below . The overall gasification level in Armenia at 95 % is nearly complete ; this means that almost all consumers have access to the gas system . Notwithstanding this fact , many people especially in rural communities still use biomass ( wood and/or manure ) for heating , cooking and hot water . The underground gas storage facility in Abovyan , which has capacity of around 140 million cubic meters ( m3 ) , provides an opportunity to regulate daily load fluctuations in heavy demand periods such as winter days , as well as to accumulate some amount of gas to provide uninterrupted supply in emergency situations . Finally , it should be noted that gas imports from Russia are used for all domestic needs ( including electricity generation ) , while gas imports from the south are primarily used for electricity generation in the context
