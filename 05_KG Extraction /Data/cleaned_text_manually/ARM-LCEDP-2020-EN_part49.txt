adding nearly 3,000 MW of grid-connected solar and over 1,000 MW of wind power by 2036 , it was clear that some more reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES generation would be needed , both to reflect potential limitations in institutional capacity to build so much new solar and wind in the coming decades and to ensure the planning and investment for any needed system strengthening that might be required to accommodate the higher shares of VRES in the total generation mix . Thus , through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed that a reasonable level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would be set at 1,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning horizon , along with limits on the annual build rates . This set of added assumptions was then applied to the baseline model and the results , described earlier and summarized in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 establish the Baseline Reference ( BASE-R ) Scenario . In this scenario - as was ultimately seen in all other scenarios as well - the full amount of constrained solar and wind capacity is added , reflecting its significant role as a least-cost source of electricity for Armenia ’ s development . While some additional hydropower capacity is added in the BASE-R scenario to account for licenses already provided by PSRC , no other types of new generation are selected by the model ( taking into account that the gas-fired Yerevan CCGT-2 TPP is already included from 2022 ) and recognizing that this scenario foresees closure of the ANPP from 2027 according to current planning . The total funding required for new power plant construction in this scenario is just under $ 1.9 billion , while projected imported natural gas fuel expenditures for electricity generation are $ 4.25 billion . Finally , in the BASE-R scenario total energy system costs27 account for roughly 11 % of GDP over the planning period , while the energy intensity of GDP as measured by TPES is around 8.37 MJ/ $ . Taking into consideration that GDP growth is the main driver of energy demand growth , two sensitivity analyses were modelled to explore the influence of higher and lower GDP growth rates on the Armenian energy system ’ s least cost development pathway . In particular , the cases analysed were for a 50 % higher growth rate ( 6.75 % per year from 2022 ) and a 50 % lower rate ( 2.25 % per year from 2022 , as compared to the 4.5 % per annum GDP growth rate in the BASE-R scenario . While these higher ( lower ) growth rates have expected impacts in regard to increasing ( decreasing ) total system costs , TPES , FEC and electricity generation , it is especially interesting to note that the higher GDP growth rate also reduces the share of total system cost in GDP , owing to the fact
