nuclear capacity in Armenia ’ energy mix . It should be emphasized that such life extensions must always first and foremost ensure all measures required for continued safe and reliable operation of these older plants . This is not surprising , given that in these scenarios , with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES fully utilized , the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to selection of the new nuclear technologies , in this case introduction of 600 MW of nuclear power . Given the slightly different implementation patterns for the introduction of nuclear units in these scenarios as compared to the forced implementation in 2027 examined earlier , the impact on total investment costs for new power generation capacity is even larger compared to the BASE-R scenario , ranging from $ 5.4 - $ 7.0 billion . As a final point , it is useful to note that the scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet the level defined in Armenia ’ s NDC , either by 2036 or earlier , largely mirror the “ new nuclear ” scenarios in terms of increases in total system cost and TPES , reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in imports of natural gas for electricity generation . # 5.3 DIFFERENT TRENDS IN IMPORTED GAS PRICES The BASE-R scenario assumed that the natural gas price will increase up to projected European levels by 2027 ( the year of ANPP decommissioning ) and after that continue to match European levels . Historically Armenia has negotiated gas prices with Russia below these rates , so two scenarios were analyzed with lower gas prices as28 : • EU trend rate to 2036 : Applies the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036 ; • Growth to $ 180 by 2027 : Assumes the border gas prices grows to US $ 180/1000 m3 by 2027 and remains fixed at that level until the end of the planning period . ; As expected , analysis of these scenarios shows that if Russia continues to provide relatively low-cost natural gas to Armenia there will be a significant increase of natural gas consumption across all sectors , but mainly in electricity generation , transportation and residential heating . In both scenarios , the expanded use of existing gas-fired TPP capacity means that the mid-sized HPPs ( Shnokh and Loriberd ) are not built , while no additional thermal power capacity is required after the inclusion of Yerevan CCGT-2 ( RENCO ) and the closure of Hrazdan TPP . This results in a roughly 20 % reduction in the lumpsum investment required for new generation in these scenarios , the lowest in any scenarios - although still with the constrained levels of solar and wind generation fully built - which generates an investment cost saving as compared to BASE-R of $ 377 million in the case with the EU trend to 2036 and of $ 391 million when the gas price is
