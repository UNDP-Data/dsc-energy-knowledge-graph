Programme rationale 1 . The 2017 general elections ushered in a new era in Angola , with a change of President after 38 years . There is strong political commitment to strengthen democratic governance , justice and human rights , and fight corruption . Creating the first-ever elected local governments in 2020 is a flagship policy . 2 . Governance , justice and human rights institutions at national and local levels remain fragile in responding to ongoing structural reforms and meeting citizens â€™ growing demand for inclusive , participatory governance , transparency and accountability in public management and for effective service delivery . 3 . Advances in democracy and rights are taking place in a context of tight fiscal space and deceleration of economic growth , as result of the sharp decrease in oil prices and its related tax revenues . Oil revenues accounted for 96 per cent of total revenues in 2017 . This caused public debt to rise to 91 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . Public debt operations account for 48.2 per cent of the state budget in 2019 and consume 70 per cent of fiscal revenues . 4 . Within this tight fiscal space , Angola aims to eradicate poverty . Thirty-six per cent of Angolans live in extreme poverty . In 2018 , 51.2 per cent of Angolans were multidimensionally poor , with 29.9 per cent in urban and 88.2 per cent in rural areas.5 The 2018 Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis ( MODA ) on multidimensional child poverty in Angola concluded that 77.4 per cent of children under 18 are poor.6 The Gini coefficient was 0.43 in 2008.Due to higher life expectancy , Angola improved its human development index ( HDI ) to medium human development status , ranking 147 out of 189 countries in 2017 , with an HDI of 0.581.8 The tight fiscal space underscoresthe importance of increased private investments that support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals . 5 . Angola will graduate from the least developed country ( LDC ) category in February 2021 , based on the income-only criterion
