of the swap contract . # MAIN INDICATORS OF NATURAL GAS SUPPLY , 2016 Armenia gasification level ~94.6 % ; Length of the pipelines , km 14,600 ; Number of gasified communities 624 ; Number of consumers 692,114 ; Import , million m3 , of which 2,237/2,372 ; from Russia 1,865/2,001 ; from Iran 372/371 ; Abovyan Underground Gas Storage Facility 140 million m3 ; Gasification in Armenia started from 1960 and as of 2016 the Russian firm Gazprom was the sole shareholder of CJSC Gazprom Armenia , which is the sole provider of supply and sales of natural gas for the domestic market . The bulk gas transportation system includes 1,682.2 km of main and branch gas pipelines , of which 1,586.5 km of gas pipelines are involved in gas transportation activities and the rest is in operational reserve mode . There are also 110 gas distribution stations ; 21 metering units , including the Koghb gas measuring station on the Armenia-Georgia border ; 181 electrochemical protection installations , including 166 cathodic and 15 drainage systems . The Abovyan gas storage facility includes 21 underground tanks and compressor stations . The main operational indicators of the gas transportation system for 2016 are shown in Table 1.4 . Combined losses in the gas transportation and distribution systems amounted to around 143 million m3 ; at roughly 6.4 % of total imported gas volume these are high , but typical for former Soviet Union systems . # MAIN INDICATORS OF THE GAS SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR 2016 , in MILLION M3 Volume of imported gas , including : 2,236.5 ( From Russia 1,864.6 , From South 372.0 ) ; Gas taken from pipelines & underground storage : 50.2 ; Own use of gas in transportation system : 3.5 ; Losses in gas transportation system , 102.5 ; of which Technical losses in the pipeline are 102.0 and Emergency losses are 0.5 ; Driven by gas pipelines & underground storage : 48.3 ; Volume of transported gas : 2,132.4 ; Other consumers : 244.4 ; Distribution system : 1,888.1 ; Own use of gas distribution system : 3.1 ; Recovered gas : 0.7 ; Gas distribution system losses : 40.1 ; Volume of gas sold by distribution system , 1,844.3 , of which Population is 581.0 , Energy is 420.0 , Industry is 185.8 , CNG compressor stations are 467.3 , Budget organizations are 54.3 , other consumers are 135.8 ; Average calorific value of natural gas is 8,193 ( kcal/m3 ) ; Source : Public Services Regulatory Commission ( PSRC ) . ; # 1.4 USE OF OTHER ENERGY CARRIERS IN 2016 Given that the TIMES model is a tool for optimizing all fuel and energy flows in a system , including production , transformation and consumption , it is necessary to analyze and incorporate all relevant data into the model . The best way to do this is to use the internationally approved country energy balance . This section presents the
