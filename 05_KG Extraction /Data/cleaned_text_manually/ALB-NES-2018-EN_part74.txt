With the approval of the new law on renewable , and the new Market Model , only the small RES Producers with installed capacity up to 2 MW ( PV ) and 3 MW ( Wind ) will continue to benefit from the feed-in tariffs , while other Priority RES Producers with installed capacity from 2 to 15MW will be subject of feed-in premium provided through the CfD applied for them in the day ahead market . Therefore , this RES support is covered by final customers through a dedicated surcharge in their final rates , and the primary state budget funding to be allocated for RES support will go towards awareness campaigns and pilot projects , which indirectly will assist to achieve the national RES target .
