as compared to the BASE-R scenario , with only the implementation schedule for new solar , wind and hydro being slightly different , depending on the required consumption level in each time period . Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show the aggregate projected generation levels by plant type for each of the GDP growth scenarios and their difference from the BASE-R scenario over the planning horizon . For the case of a 50 % higher GDP growth rate , this indicates an increase of roughly 1,879 GWh of total renewable electricity generation and 1,438 GWh of gas-fired production , as compared to the BASE-R scenario , while in the in the case of a 50 % lower GDP growth rate these figures show reductions of 803 GWh in generation from renewables and of 982 GWh from gas-fired generation . As noted earlier , in both of the GDP growth rate sensitivity cases the main changes in TPES and FEC are associated with changing demand for natural gas and oil products in the transport and residential sectors . Thus , there are only slight differences in timing of power system installed capacities and in the structure of electricity generation related to the timing of implementation of different technologies as compared to the BASE-R scenario . As shown in Figure 4.7 and Table 4.6 , this is reflected again in virtually no change in the total lumpsum investment in new generation required as compared to the BASE-R scenario . Table 4.47 summarizes the comparative fuel costs for electricity generation in each of the GDP growth scenarios , as compared to the BASE-R scenario . Note that in case of a 50 % higher GDP growth rate , the additional utilization of gas-fired thermal power plants results in an increase of expenditures on natural gas for electricity generation by $ 425 million , + 10.0 % compared to BASE-R , while in the case of a 50 % lower GDP growth rate this is reduced by $ 254 million or - 6.0 % compared to the BASE-R scenario . Finally , as shown in Table 4.8 , the TIMES Armenia model results confirm that the level of fossil fuel consumption will tend to change GHG emissions in the system as compared to the BASE-R scenario , by a range from an increase of 7.9 % in the case of higher GDP growth to a decrease of -4.7 % in with the lower GDP rate . The TIMES Armenia model analysis of the effects of higher and lower GDP growth rates , covering the range of +/- 50 % over the period from 2022 to 2036 , confirmed expected increases ( and decreases ) in energy supply , end use consumption and GHG emissions , with interesting impacts from the increased adoption of energy efficient demand devices in the case of rising incomes which lead to an overall pattern of decreasing energy intensity per unit of GDP as income rises ( with conversely less impact
