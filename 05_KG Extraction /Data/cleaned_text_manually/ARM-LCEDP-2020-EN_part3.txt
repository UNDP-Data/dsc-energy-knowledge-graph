in particular , solar and wind energy , are the clear least-cost sources for new generation capacity in Armenia , a clear reflection of the combination of Armenia ’ s rich solar resource and trends in declining cost of solar power over the planning period . Given that the initial unconstrained level of projected VRES capacity in the baseline scenario was so high , adding nearly 3,000 MW of grid-connected solar and over 1,000 MW of wind power by 2036 , it was clear that more reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES generation would be needed . Through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed that there was a need to reflect both potential limitations in the institutional capacity to build so much new solar and wind in the coming decades – which led to annual build-rate constraints - and in the need to ensure planning and investment for any system strengthening that would be required to accommodate higher rates of VRES penetration in the total generation mix . This consultation process established that a reasonable and ambitious level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would be 1,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning horizon , along with limits on the annual build rates . When this set of added constraints was applied to the baseline model , the results established the Baseline Reference ( BASE-R ) Scenario . In this BASE-R scenario , which foresees closure of the Armenia Nuclear Power Plant ( ANPP ) from 2027 according to current planning - as was ultimately seen in all other scenarios as well - the full amount of constrained solar and wind capacity is added , reflecting the significant role of these VRES as the least-cost source of electricity for Armenia ’ s development . While some additional hydropower capacity was also added in the BASE-R scenario , no other types of new generation are selected by the model , taking into account that the gas-fired Yerevan CCGT-2 TPP has already been included from 2022 . The total required funding for new power plant construction in the BASE-R scenario is just under $ 1.9 billion over the entire planning period , while projected expenditures on imported natural gas fuel for electricity generation are $ 4.25 billion . The fact that the full constrained amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the model as part of the least cost solution for new generation under all scenarios underscores the importance to Armenia of ensuring a policy and institutional environment that supports full realization of new VRES generation to the maximum extent practicable , not only to ensure the lowest cost generation but also to minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen Armenia ’ s energy security and competitiveness . # GDP Growth Sensitivities in the Baseline Scenario Considering that GDP growth is a key main driver of energy demand growth , two sensitivity analyses for the
