cents ) /kWh ; Wind Power Plants 42.739 ( 8.854 ) AMD ( US cents ) /kWh ; Power Generated from Biomass 42.739 ( 8.854 ) AMD ( US cents ) /kWh ; Solar PV Generation 42.739 ( 8.854 ) AMD ( US cents ) /kWh ; Source : Public Services Regulatory Commission ( PSRC ) ; # 1.5.3 NATURAL GAS TARIFFS Starting from January 2017 , the structure for natural gas consumers was as presented in Table 1.9 . This includes some tariff differentiation , in particular for socially vulnerable ( poor ) households , agricultural greenhouse farms and distinguishing consumers utilizing more or less than 10,000 m3/month . # 1.5.4 MARKET PRICES OF OTHER ENERGY CARRIERS Figure 1.8 presents the unregulated annual average consumer prices for gasoline and diesel for the period 2005 - 2016 . Comparing values shows that average prices in 2016 were lower than their long-term average values : For gasoline it was AMD 375 per liter , compared to the average over the period of AMD 398 ; for diesel it was 346 AMD per liter , compared to the average over the period of AMD 370 . # 1.6 ENERGY EFFICIENCY The TIMES model is well-suited to explore how developing scenarios on energy efficiency policy and adoption can play a role in Armenia ’ s economy , creating conditions for economic growth while improving energy security . By reducing the energy intensity of economic output , energy efficiency is a key element in realizing a safe , sustainable and affordable energy supply , while meeting increasing energy demand and improving quality of life . Under existing conditions of extreme import dependence for fossil fuels , energy that Armenia ’ s citizens , businesses , and infrastructure do not use is one of the cheapest , cleanest , and most secure energy resources . Government of Armenia policy is to promote energy efficiency in all economic sectors according to definitions formulated in the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ( 2004 ) , and as articulated in the National Program on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ( 2007 ) , the Action Plan of Armenian Government for Implementation of National Program on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ( 2010 ) , the President ’ s Order on Approval of Armenian Energy Security Concept ( 2013 ) , the Energy Security Action Plan for 2014-2020 ( 2014 ) and the Long-Term ( up to 2036 ) Development Pathways of the Armenian Energy Sector ( 2015 ) . Further , on February 2 , 2017 , Government of Armenia ( GOAM ) approved the Energy Efficiency Action Plan for 2017-2018 . In 2016 amendments to Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy were approved by Parliament which included some specific minimum energy efficiency requirements . The amended Law in particular requested the Government to classify economic sectors by their energy intensity levels as high , medium and low and established mandatory energy efficiency and energy
