The bar chart shows the proportion of a country 's land area in each of these classes and the global distribution of land area across the classes ( for comparison ) . Onshore wind : Potential wind power density ( W/m2 ) is shown in the seven classes used by NREL , measured at a height of 100m . The bar chart shows the distribution of the country 's land area in each of these classes compared to the global distribution of wind resources . Areas in the third class or above are considered to be a good wind resource . Biomass : Net primary production ( NPP ) is the amount of carbon fixed by plants and accumulated as biomass each year . It is a basic measure of biomass productivity . The chart shows the average NPP in the country ( tC/ha/yr ) , compared to the global average NPP of 3-4 tonnes of carbon = Global average of 3-4 tC/ha/yr IRENA Headquarters Masdar City P.O .
