for the transformation of primary resources into energy services . In the TIMES model , these techno-economic parameters are described in the form of technologies ( or processes ) that transform some commodities into others ( fuels , materials , energy services , emissions ) . In the TIMES model , some technologies may be user imposed , while others may simply be available for the model to choose from . The quality of a TIMES model rests on a rich , well-developed set of technologies , both current and future , for the model to choose from . This emphasis on the technological database is one of the main distinguishing factors of the class of bottom-up models to which TIMES belongs . Other classes of models will tend to emphasize other aspects of the system ( e.g . interactions with the rest of the economy ) and may treat the technical system in a more succinct manner , e.g. , via aggregate production functions . # 2.3 THE TIMES-ARMENIA MODEL PLATFORM Following the generic process described above , as described in the following Chapter the TIMES-Armenia model incorporates the key inputs as presented in the following lists with Times-Armenia Key Inputs : # Energy Balance Most recent overall energy balance , showing for each fuel : ; ‐ Supply by source ; ‐ Use of electricity/heat and distribution losses ; ‐ Use of different energy carriers in demand devices ; ‐ Consumption by sector ; # Resources  Annual production maximum and associated price ;  Total proven reserves ; # Technologies  Existing stock of power plants and devices ;  Fuels in/out , efficiency , availability in each milestone year , technical life duration ; # Demand Services  Level of energy service to be met in each period ;  Simplified electricity load duration curve and seasonal gas use ;  Amount of fuel switching permitted over time ; # Global  Length of each season/time of day ;  Discount rate , electricity reserve margin ; These inputs are then combined with defined policy scenarios as depicted in Figure 2.3 and lead to the key results as presented in the follwing lists : # Total Energy & System Cost Total discounted cost of all fuel purchases , power plant builds , device purchases , operating & maintenance costs over the entire planning horizon ; # Resources Annual production level , and marginal price if constrained and limit is reached ; # Technologies  Total installed capacity in each period ;  Annual new power plant builds and expenditure ;  Annual fixed and variable operating and fuel costs ;  Annual & season/time of day ( for power plants ) utilization ;  Marginal cost , if constrained and limit is reached ; # Energy Carriers  Annual amount consumed by each technology & by sector ;  Marginal price ( by season/time of day for electricity ) ; # Demand Services  Marginal price
