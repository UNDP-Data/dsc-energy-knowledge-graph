5-year life extension for the ANPP , the total installed capacity of new power plants is the same as in BASE-R , with differences in the timing of the implementation schedule for new hydro , solar , and wind facilities . In the scenario with ANPP life extension up to the end of the planning period , overall new generation capacity is reduced by -5.7 % , as noted earlier through the exclusion of new medium-sized hydro plants . In both scenarios that introduce new nuclear capacity after the decommissioning of ANPP , the additional capacity increases of 300 and 600 MW for the new nuclear units is offset by the elimination of medium-sized hydro ( 141 MW ) , while in the LWR 600 MW scenario there is a further reduction of new wind generation capacity ( by 114 MW ) . Table 4.13 below presents projected installed electricity generation capacities by plant or plant type for each scenario . As noted earlier , the scenarios including nuclear generation lead to somewhat later introduction of wind , with slightly reduced level compared to constraint limits in the LWR 600 MW scenario , and these scenarios eliminate the addition of medium-sized HPPs , except in the case of ANPP extension only to 2032 . Figure 4.11 shows the aggregate projected generation levels by plant type over the planning horizon , which for the most part mirrors the installed capacity trends above , with the notable exception of gas-fired plants which show a marked difference by scenario . In all nuclear option scenarios the level of gas-fired generation is reduced compared to the BASE-R scenario : by 23 % when ANPP is extended to 2032 ( i.e. , 958 million m3 less gas is used over the planning period ) ; by 49 % when ANPP is extended to 2037 ( with 2,027 million m3 less gas used ) ; by 35 % for the new nuclear SMR 300 MW option ( with 1,511 million m3 less gas used ) ; and by 63 % for the new nuclear LWR 600 MW scenario ( with 2,638 million m3 less gas used ) . While no gas-fired capacity is added in any scenario , it is striking that in the scenario when the 600 MW LWR is added to the system the model does not elect to run existing gas plants at all after 2027 . Table 4.14 summarizes the comparative gas fuel cost savings in each of the nuclear scenarios as compared to BASE-R . While these represent significant savings in imported fuel , they are in general offset by increased investment costs , in particular in the two scenarios with new-build nuclear generation . Table 4.15 above presents the lumpsum ( undiscounted ) investment costs for additional generation capacity by plant type over the planning horizon , while Table 4.16 summarizes the differences in investment levels required , by scenario . Life extension of the ANPP to 2032 increases these
