to occur . Other data ( e.g. , demand projections ) will be specified according to the MileStoneYears . # 2 . GDP growth Historical GDP in Armenia ( 2007-2017 ) Simplified average annual GDP growth for the last decade ( 2007-2017 ) is 3.5 % . If we are considering only economy recovery period ( 2010-2017 ) then GDP growth is amounted to 4.0 % . Taking into consideration high GDP growth for 2017 ( 7.5 % ) the following GDP forecast done by International Monetary Fund can be used for TIMES-Armenia model . Anyway , another option could be the WB forecast due to low average GDP growth ( 3.6 % ) for the period 2013-2017 . # IMF forecast of annual GDP growth ( currently in the model ) 2018 6.0 % ; 2019 4.8 % ; 2020 4.5 % ; 2021 4.5 % ; 2022 4.5 % ; 2023 4.5 % ; # WB forecast of annual GDP growth38 2018 4.1 % ; 2019 4.0 % ; 2020 4.0 % ; The last value of GDP growth remains unchanged till the end of planning period ! # 3 . Generation capacities # 3.1 . Available capacities ( Base Year-2016 ) + as of the end of 2017 # 3.2 . Potential Capacities # 4. International agreement on gas/electricity swap Base case : Up to end of planning period ( 2036 ) exports will remain at the current level : 1,200 GWh/year – 400 million m3 of natural gas – forced After 2027 , two scenarios should be considered : a . Swap – optional at the contractual level 6,900 GWh/year – 2,300 million m3 b . No swap – forced ( if TIMES will choose continuation of agreement ) # 5 . Electricity Import and export a . North : Currently no electricity exchange takes place between Armenia and North . There is only net zero balance condition required in the future . b . South : Currently no electricity exchange takes place between Armenia and South , other than to cover the swap . There is a net zero balance condition required from one Agreement , and 3 kWh for each 1 m3 – the second Agreement . # 6 . Gas Import price Up to 2026 gas price will be kept at current level ( $ 150/1000m3 ) , thereafter – European commercial prices apply , WB forecast # 7 . Energy Efficiency - Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources Energy efficiency is modelled as an 8 % 55reduction of overall energy demand . # APPENDIX 4 . MAIN RESULTS FOR CORE SCENARIOS In the sections that follow key results are presented for each of the core policy scenarios examined .
