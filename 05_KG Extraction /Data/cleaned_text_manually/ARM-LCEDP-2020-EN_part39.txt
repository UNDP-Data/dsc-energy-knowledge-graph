4.16 and 4.17 show the aggregate projected generation levels by plant type for each of the lower gas price scenarios and their difference from the BASE-R scenario over the planning horizon , respectively . For the EU trend to 2036 scenario , this indicates replacement of roughly 6,186 GWh of total renewable electricity generation by 5,833 GWh of gas-fired production , as compared to the BASE-R scenario , while in the scenario with gas price capped at $ 180 , generation from VRES is reduced by 9,460 GWh and gas-fired generation is increased by 9,401 GWh . As noted earlier , in both of the low gas price scenarios the mid-sized HPPs are not built while the expanded supply of electricity from gas-fired thermal generation does not require any new capacity . As shown in Figure 4.18 and Table 4.22 , this results in roughly 20 % reduction in the lumpsum investment required , a saving of $ 377 million in the EU trend to 2036 scenario and of $ 391 million in the scenario with gas price capped at $ 180 , as compared to BASE-R. Table 4.23 summarizes the comparative fuel cost savings for electricity generation in each of the low gas price scenarios , as compared to the BASE-R scenario . Notwithstanding the substantial increase in the total volume of imported gas , the lower prices still result in a significant cost reduction in both scenarios , with the total cost savings in imported fuel amounting to $ 948 million in the EU trend scenario and increasing to $ 1,418 million in the scenario with the gas process capped at $ 180 per 1000 m3 . Finally , the TIMES Armenia model results confirm that reduced use of renewable energy replaced by fossil fuels will tend to increase GHG emissions in the system as compared to the BASE-R scenario , by a range from 2.2 % to 3.5 % , as shown in Table 4.24 . # 4.4 REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO ELECTRICITY # 4.4.1 SCENARIO DESCRIPTION The analysis of final energy consumption by energy carriers and sectors showed that the most consumed fuel source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas , virtually all of which is used for residential heating and transport . Since increased electricity generation based on the development of renewable energy resources is indicated as a least cost solution in the BASE-R scenario , expanding the use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and in residential sectors to replace natural gas imports . To explore these opportunities , we examine the following scenarios : • Increase in the penetration level for the use of electricity in residential heating to 25 % in 2027 and to 50 % by 2036 ; • Increase in the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25 % in 2027 and to 50 % by 2036 ; •
