UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 1 . Niger , a low-income country located in the heart of the Sahel region along the Lake Chad Basin , is endowed with immense natural resources , including oil reserves that cover 90 per cent of its territory , but still marginally exploited . The country ’ s development faces strong socioeconomic , environmental and security constraints that impede its timely attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) . Governance challenges are rooted in unresolved historical inequalities and a weakened social contract , which leads to polarization in a context where only 13.6 per cent of the population has access to electricity for productive use . 2 . Multidimensional poverty affects 90.5 per cent of the country ’ s population of 20 million , with 83 per cent in rural areas , 78 per cent women and 70 per cent between the ages of 15 to 24 , who are not in employment , education or training . Persons with disabilities account for 4.2 per cent of the population and are often subjected to stigma and exclusion in education , employment and social protection . Globally , with a human development index of 0.394 , Niger ranks last among 189 countries , with the highest population growth at 3.9 per cent . 3 . The COVID-19 pandemic , the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war , rising insecurity along borderlands with neighbouring countries , and a poor 2021 crop season have aggravated the socioeconomic and humanitarian situation . Security challenges cost the State 17 per cent and 22.1 per cent of its budgetary resources in 2021 and 2022 , respectively , severely constraining investments in the productive sector . Economic growth declined from 5.9 per cent in 2019 to 1.3 per cent in 2021 , with a 0.7 per cent contraction of gross domestic product at the tertiary level . Implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area ( AfCFTA ) strategy presents undeniable opportunities to expand and diversify exports and economic partners , provided political stability is sustained to advance progress on national priorities . 4 . The country ’ s Vision 2035 , set out in its sustainable development and inclusive growth strategy , aims to make Niger a well-governed , peaceful , emerging economy based on fair sharing of the fruits of progress . Recognizing that only eight years remain in the Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs , the Government has defined the national development priorities for
