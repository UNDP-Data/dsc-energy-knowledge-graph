after 2027 ; and forced implementation of a new nuclear unit , either with installed capacity 300 MW ( Small Modular Reactor ) or with installed capacity 600 MW ( Light Water Reactor ) . The scenarios for life extension of the ANPP by 5 and 10 years decrease total system cost by around 1 % , compared to eth BASE-R scenario , increase total primary energy supply by 3.7 % and 7.3 % , reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions significantly by 4.5 % and 9.3 % and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 11.8 % and 20.4 % , respectively . A key feature of these scenarios is that they increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity 15.1 % and 12.5 % , compared the BASE-R scenario , with the higher investment costs needed for the longer extension being offset in its impact on total investment by the fact that in this scenario neither of the mid-sized HPPs ( Shnokh and Loriberd ) are built . The scenarios which propose new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 with either a 300 MW SMR or a 600 MW LWR increase total system cost by around 2 % , increase primary energy supply by 3.3 % and 7.8 % , reduce GHG emissions by 7.1 % and 12.2 % , and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 7.2 % and 15.5 % , respectively . A key impact in these scenarios is that they significantly increase the required total investment costs for new power generation capacity compared the BASE-R scenario , more than doubling it to $ 4.1 billion ( a 116 % increase ) for the 300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $ 5 billion ( a 164 % increase ) for the 600 MW LWR unit . Thus , whether considering total system cost or investment costs required for new generation , the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP represent a least-cost policy choice for continuing to maintain nuclear capacity in Armenia ’ energy mix . It must be emphasized that such life extensions must first and foremost always ensure all measures required for the continued safe and reliable operation of these older plants . As a final point , it is useful to note that the scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet the level defined in Armenia ’ s Nationally Determined Commitment , either by 2036 or earlier , largely mirror the “ new nuclear ” scenarios in terms of increases in total system cost and primary energy supply , reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in imports of natural gas for electricity generation . This is not surprising , given that in these scenarios , with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES fully utilized , the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to selection of the new nuclear technologies , in this case introduction of
