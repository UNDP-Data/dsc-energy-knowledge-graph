Further development of domestic energy sources , and diversification of supply sources and interconnection with the regional Energy Community and European electricity and gas networks  Establish a competitive market that provides correct signals for production and consumption of electricity and gas ;  Provide incentives for implementing the necessary climate action policies , such as reaching renewable energy resource ( RES ) and energy efficiency targets and for decreasing adverse environmental impacts.The following long-term strategic objectives were identified to actualize the Guiding Principles and the current commitments that have been undertaken by the Albanian government . ;  Improving the reliability and security of energy supply ;  Developing the domestic primary energy sources in a sustainable and competitive manner ;  Improving the cost-effectiveness of energy supply systems ;  Achieving the targets for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency established in the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan ;  Developing least-cost and sustainable policy for residential heating and cooling ;  Integrating the Albanian power and natural gas markets with regional Energy Community and European markets ; and ;  Achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution ( NDC ) targets for greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission reductions . ; # 2.3 POLICY SCENARIOS The key policies impacting the Energy Sector and related climate actions in Albania include policies needed to :  Meet the current commitments to the Energy Community for energy efficiency and renewable energy implementation , and the country ’ s GHG reduction commitment under the Paris Accords and other climate actions policies as part of WB6 commitments , ;  Prepare for a possible natural gas market within Albania , and ;  Better integrate with the EU and regional markets , with a specific focus on efforts for coupling the Albanian and Kosovo electricity markets as a first step toward regional market coupling . To understand the costs and benefits of these possible policies , the following six scenarios were developed and analyzed using the Albania-LEAP model . ;  Baseline Scenario : This represents the most likely evolution of the Albanian energy sector with no any further policy interventions . This scenario is the base for comparison with the policy scenarios below . ;  Energy Efficiency ( EE ) : This scenario assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty commitments by implementing the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and enforces the Law on Energy Efficiency ( together with improvement of the Law to transpose EED requirements ) and the Law on Energy Performance in Buildings . ;  Renewable Energy Sources ( RES ) : Assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty commitments of reaching a 38 % renewable energy target in 2020 by implementing the Albanian National Renewable Energy Action Plan . ;  Natural Gas Promotion : Assumes maximum possible penetration of natural gas in line with the Gas Master Plan . ;  Albania-Kosovo Coupling : Assumes
