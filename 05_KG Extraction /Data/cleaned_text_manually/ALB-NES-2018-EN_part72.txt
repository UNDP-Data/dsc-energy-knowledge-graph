The Strategy takes into account the current domestic import , and identifies the internal infrastructure of crude oil and oil by products transport , product stocking , and modern standards management needed to reach a minimal cost of service for oil and oil byproducts and avoid temporary market abnormalities . The investments required for exploration and oil production are based on information from AKBN for existing and new oil fields . The Strategy supports the rehabilitation of Ballsh and Fier refineries to European norms and standards , including adoption of environmental norms ( below 1 % sulphur ) for refinery products and technology , increasing refinery processing capacity to 1.5 Mt/year , modernization of Vlora terminal , and modernization of transport infrastructure from Vlora to Ballsh . Investment costs for rehabilitation and modernization of the two refineries depends directly on the actual situation of installations , equipment and environment pollution level . Ministry of Energy and Industry also is considering the option of building new refineries with 3.2 Million tons capacities . Estimates for the investment cost required for rehabilitation of the existing refineries and constructing new refineries are based on information from AKBN . Fuel oil by product market infrastructure in Albania includes a large number of distributors , and the total number of retail stations should be reduced and better optimized according to European norms and standards . The investment required for improvements to the downstream infrastructure for oil byproducts are also based on information from AKBN . Table 16 provides the cumulative oil sector investment costs for 2018 to 2030 , expressed in million Euros ( MEUR ) , for exploration and production , rehabilitation , infrastructure improvements and construction of new refineries , and Table 24 provides the annual investment profile for each component .
