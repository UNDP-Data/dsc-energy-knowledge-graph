major technological breakthroughs , solar power will be the cheapest form of electricity in many regions of the world . Depending on annual sunshine , power cost of 4–6 cents/kWh are expected by 2025 , reaching 2–4 cents/kWh by 2050 ; • By end of 2015 , global concentrating PV ( CPV ) capacity reached 360 MW , most of which are high-concentration systems ( CR : 300-1000 ) [ Renewables 2016 Global Status Report , REN21 ] . With concentrator technology , module efficiencies of up to 38.9 % ( lab record ) & 33 % ( commercially ) have been reached . [ Photovoltaics Report 2016 , Fraunhofer ISE ] ; • Since first floating plant installation in 2007 , the total installed capacity globally has now reached 93 MWp with 70 floating PV plant worldwide . The biggest floating plant has a capacity of 20 MWp . ; • A new form of CSP , called STEM ( Solar Thermo Electric Magaldi ) , which uses fluidized silica sand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium to produce 24-hour industrial scale power for off-grid applications is receiving international interest . By using fluidized solids as alternative to other storage media , the use of corrosive or environmentally unfriendly fluids can be cut down and the receiver can be operated at much higher temperature . On 30th June 2016 , the first STEM industrial model plant started operations in San Filippo del Mela ( Sicily ) . ; • Repowering , i.e . replacing old wind turbines with modern higher capacity turbines , is on the rise . It has led to increase in wind power while reducing the footprint . A 2 MW wind turbine with an 80-m diameter rotor now generates four to six times more electricity than a 500 kW , 40 m diameter rotor built in 1995 . [ IEA Website ] ; • Bioenergy accounts for around 7 % of all industrial heat consumption , and has not increased in recent years . [ Renewables 2017 Global Status Report , REN21 ] ; • Asia has the highest number of small-scale biogas digesters , with more than 100 million people in rural China and 4.83 million people in India have access to digesters to produce gas for cooking and space heating . [ Renewables 2016 Global Status Report , REN21 ] ; • Two lithium ion battery storage projects totalling 37.5 MW & 150 MWh is under construction phase in Southern California . When completed , the larger , 120 MWh ( 30 MW for 4 hours ) project will be the single biggest lithium ion battery in service on a utility grid in the world . In March 2016 , a project with 50 MW , 300 MWh sodium-sulfur battery facility went into service . ; • In October 2016 , the Powerwall 2 ( an upgrade to its previous version ) , a home battery unit , was unveiled by
