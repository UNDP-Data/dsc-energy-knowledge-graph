( 2021-2032 ) . 2 . The overall goal is to achieve 95 % of the total energy mix of 5000 MW to 6000 MW by 2032 translating to a deployment of 4500 MW to 5000 MW of RETs .. 3 . In order to achieve the above targets , AREPTERM 1 will identify high priority sectors with strategic objectives where deployment of REN projects will be taken up in a programmatic modeAfew of these high priority sectors are : objective of reducing the consumption of diesel and switching to a cleaner option . b . Rehabilitation of non-operational/ partly operational REN projects preferably through PPP mode ensuring their socio- economic sustainability . c. Provinces which will not be serviced by DABS in near future as per the PSMP . d. Distributed generation in economic zones and industrial parks for providing reliable electricity to boost commercial and industrial activities . e. Grid-connected projects in Public-Private-Partnership ( PPP ) mode . f. Solar and/or wind pumping with finance facilitation to farmers for increasing the agricultural productivity . g. Powering mobile telephone network and other telecommunication infrastructure through REN in remote areas for enhancing safety and security of communities . h. Roof-top solar PV projects with or without net metering . I . The RE Project for growth of Agriculture sector to supply energy for springhouses , livestock 's etc.â€¦ j. Biomass energy projects for the rural communities and livestock 's . The proper AREP implementation will lead to formation of Renewable Energy Law for Afghanistan by 2032 , clearly defining the energy share from renewable energy to keep that growing as per Afghanistan National Strategy and other related policies.Type of Energy Potential Work Done Solar 222,000 MW * 300 days of sunlight Average solar insolation of 6.5 kWh/m2/day Stand alone : Many systems deployed Mini-grid : pilot mini-grids ( upto 1MW ) deployed Grid Tied : Draft Grid-tie ( Kabul Area ) prefeasibility report Roof-top grid Tentative project with Capacity of 0.5 to 3 KW Generation license MHP 23,000 MW * hydro potential ( including large dams ) 600 MW Mini and Micro potential Pilot projects ( including payfor- power mini-grids ) Prefeasibility studies 125 MHP sites survey Factsheets Wind 67,000 MW * 36,000 Km2 windy land 5 MW per Km2 16 nos . wind monitoring towers 1 year wind data 100 and 30 kW pilot project Generation license Biomass 4000 MW * 91 MW MSW 3090 MW agriculture waste 840 MW animal waste 300 Biogas plants Surveys Factsheets W2E business plan Waste water treatment Geo-Thermal 3 big possible regions 70 spots 4-100 MW 2 studies Business proposal 3.1 The macro level mapping of REN resources in Afghanistan has been done and is presented in the below table . 3.2 In order to facilitate the long-term planning for REN projects , a detailed zonewise mapping of REN resources would be undertaken and the REN Atlas for Afghanistan will be prepared . 3.3 In case of MHP , it should be ensured
