THE TIMES-ARMENIA MODEL AND ITS BASELINE-REFERENCE SCENARIO # 3.1 SCENARIO MODELLING Having described the structure of the TIMES-Armenia model in the previous section , the model was then calibrated for the base year ( 2016 ) , the first modelling year . The task of then assembling a view of the future Baseline Reference Scenario was undertaken starting with the preparation of the future demand projection , future fuel prices , the power sector presently , and the suite of demand-side options as discussed in the following sections . # 3.1.1 KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR DEMAND DRIVERS The key assumptions regarding the main drivers used to project future demand for energy services , income ( as reflected by GDP ) and population levels and growth rates , are shown in Table 3.1 , below . Given the predominance of gas in Armenia ’ s energy balance , it is further assumed that the natural gas price in Armenia will reach the European level by 2027 ( IEA projection : Section 4.3 of World Energy Outlook 2018 , International Energy Agency ) and then follow it , as presented in Figure 3.1 ( Blue line ) . The same trend is assumed for the gas price at power plant input points ( Figure 3.1 , Orange line ) . Prices for oil products and coal are forecast in accordance with European trends ( IEA World Energy Outlook 2018 ) , with a starting point from the real Armenian prices for 2016 , corrected to 2018 . It is assumed that the price of main oil products will increase around 123 % by 2036 , to reach the following levels : LPG , US $ 0.43/l ; gasoline , US $ 0.987/l ; diesel , US $ 1.049/ ; kerosene , US $ 1.437/l , aviation gasoline , US $ 1.261/l ; and jet fuel , US $ 1.163/l . Nuclear fuel prices for modelled nuclear power plants are taken the same based on the special study results provided by the Ukrainian National Nuclear Electricity Generation Company Energoatom9 . Finally , accounting for the current electricity-for-natural gas swap contract is a critical assumption . The swap contract calls for imports of gas from the South at no direct cost , but in exchange for electricity exports at a rate of 1 m3 of gas = 3 kWh of electricity . It is assumed that both the swap contract and net imports from Georgia are held constant at their 2018 levels through the end of the planning period ( 2036 ) ; i.e. , net exports to South will amount to 1.52 TWh per annum , and net imports from Georgia will be 74.5 GWh p.a . # 3.2.1 DEMAND PROJECTIONS FOR USEFUL
