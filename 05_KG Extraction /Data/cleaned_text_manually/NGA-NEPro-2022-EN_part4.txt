Additional notes : Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to developing areas . Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy production divided by total primary energy supply . Energy trade includes all commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System ( HS ) . Capacity utilisation is calculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity x 8,760h/year . Avoided emissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by fossil fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector . This assumes that , if renewable power did not exist , fossil fuels would be used in its place to generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of fossil fuels . In countries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs , an average fossil fuel emission factor has been used to calculate the avoided emissions . These profiles have been produced to provide an overview of developments in renewable energy in different countries and areas .
