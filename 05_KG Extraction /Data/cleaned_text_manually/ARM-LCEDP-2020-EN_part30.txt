planning period the model results show an added capacity of grid connected Solar PV and Wind Farms near their upper permissible levels , with 1,500 MW of all types of solar PV and 503 MW of wind , as well as 107 MW of new Small HPPs ( against the existing 328 MW ; see Table 3.3 above ) , plus 75 MW of medium-size hydropower from the Shnokh HPP ( from 2027 ) and finally at the end of the planning period of the 66 MW Loriberd HPP . Both of these last-named HPPs represent the next cheapest generation technologies following solar and wind . It is useful to note again that in finding the least-cost solution , the TIMES-Armenia model takes into consideration not only the associated costs , but also efficiencies and availability factors for these HPPs . The quantity of electricity generation by each technology or plant , in GWh , over the planning period is presented in Table 3.15 . As the limited amounts of new VRES are introduced , the model shows relatively stable generation by most of the other power plants . Only generation at RENCO CCGT declines slightly between 2020 and 2024 , while generation of Hrazdan 5 TPP is needed only in a relatively small amount at the end of planning period . Figures 3.7 and 3.8 show the pattern of new generation added to the system by type and the associated total lumpsum projected investment expenditures over the planning period , which amounts to roughly US $ 1.89 billion for 2,457 MW of added capacity . In the period of decommissioning the ANPP in 2027 , the model indicates the power system should add around 540 MW of new power capacity to cover the gap of electricity generation , which is added from the lowest cost technologies at that time - Solar PV ( 300 MW ) , wind farm ( 150 MW ) and medium-sized Shnokh HPP ( 75 MW ) . During the last three planning periods to 2036 , an additional 875 MW of generation capacity is added to cover the growth of demand ; again , this comprises new VRES investment in Solar PV ( 714 MW ) , wind farms ( 95 MW ) and the medium-sized Loriberd HPP ( 66 M ) . # 3.7.3 SELECTED COMPARISONS WITH INITIAL BASELINE SCENARIO In addition to the observations in the preceding section comparing TIMES-Armenia model projections for the IU BASE and BASE-R Scenarios , we highlight the following points : As shown in Figure 3.9 , the assumed limitation on implementing new generation from VRES reduces the volume of renewables in TPES in 2036 by 36 % , from 36 PJ to 25 PJ , while gas plays an increasingly large role in TPES after decommissioning of the ANPP in 2027 , with an increased amount of between 20 â€“ 23 PJ , on average increase over the period 2027-2036 of 27 % . As shown
