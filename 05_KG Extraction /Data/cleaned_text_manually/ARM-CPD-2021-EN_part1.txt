UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 1 . The Republic of Armenia is a landlocked country in the Southern Caucasus with a population of 2.97 million . It is an upper middle-income country with a Human Development Index ( HDI ) score of 0.760 , putting Armenia in the high human development category . 2 . Despite an increase in HDI of more than 20 per cent since 1991 , 26.4 per cent of the population still lived below the poverty line in 2019 , with 2.7 per cent classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty . Disparities between urban and rural areas , gender inequality , outward migration and high climate change exposure further impact the country ’ s resilience , competitiveness and well-being . These pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities were amplified by the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , driven by extensive disruption of businesses , income insecurity/loss and the deterioration of people ’ s health and well-being , disproportionately affecting women , children , youth , older persons , persons with disabilities , people living in poverty , labour migrants , informal workers , entrepreneurs and remittance-dependent households . 3 . The recent large-scale military hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict area caused a massive displacement from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia . Among an estimated 90,000 displaced people , 88 per cent were women and children who were housed in host communities and collective shelters . A significant number of the arrivals from NagornoKarabakh may not be able to return safely even now with the ceasefire in place , particularly residents of territories currently under control of Azerbaijan . Tens of thousands of them lost their homes and productive assets . The escalation has also left a significant impact on border communities , particularly in Syunik and Tavush regions of Armenia . The needs of people displaced and affected by the recent escalation , war veterans , wounded , newly disabled and their families , and families who lost productive assets or a breadwinner , need to be prioritized on the basis of the humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality and independence
