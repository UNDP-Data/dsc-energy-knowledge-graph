UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 1 . Argentina scores very highly on the Human Development Index , ranked 46 of 189 countries in 2020 , and is classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income country , with a gross national income per capita of $ 10,006 in 2019 . Nonetheless , there is great heterogeneity between regions regarding indicators for productivity , well-being and social development . Alongside territorial inequalities , there are inequalities among population groups , where socioeconomic inequities intertwine with gender , ethnic , racial and generational inequalities , hindering the possibilities to eradicate poverty , ensure sustainable development and guarantee human rights . 2 . The country faces high macroeconomic volatility , aggravated by the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic which generated an estimated 19.1 per cent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2020 , while unemployment escalated by 9.2 percentage points over the same period . This resulted in higher rates of poverty ( 40.9 per cent ) and extreme poverty ( 10.5 per cent ) during the first half of 2021 , within a context of inflation rates over and above the regional mean ( 37.5 per cent in 2016 , 47.6 per cent in 2018 and 53.8 per cent in 2019 ) . There is also significant income inequality : the top 10 per cent of the Argentine population earns 25 times more than the most disadvantaged segment , taking into consideration per capita family income . Over half ( 56.3 per cent ) of children from 0 to14 years old are poor . The most vulnerable are children and adolescents ; lesbian , gay , bisexual , transsexual , intersex and other persons ( LGBTI+ ) ; migrants and refugees ; indigenous peoples ; Afro-descendants ; persons with disabilities ; and those deprived of their liberty . Within these groups , women face greater obstacles and more inequality than men . 3 .
